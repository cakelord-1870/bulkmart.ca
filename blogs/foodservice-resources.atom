<p>Whether you're creating a roux to make your signature macaroni and cheese, or are unsure of how much malt powder to add to your chocolate shakes, we've got you covered on all of your food thickening agent questions.</p>
<p>Creating a hearty, full-bodied winter soup or plating the perfect slice of blueberry pie all require the same secret ingredient: starch. Starches are available in many different forms, prepared using different cooking techniques, and certain starches should be used for specific recipes.</p>

<h2>What is a Food Thickener?</h2>
<p>A<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/food-thickeners" target="_blank" title="Food Thickener" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>food thickener</b></a><span> </span>is a thickening agent that increases the viscosity of a liquid mix without interfering with its other properties. Knowing how to thicken food is essential for preparing many recipes; most sauces, gravies, soups, and even desserts are thickened with some kind of starch. Each thickening agent has properties best suited for specific recipes. One of the most commonly used methods for thickening sauces and other recipes is through the gelatinization of starches.</p>

<h3>Food Thickening Methods</h3>
<p>If you attempt to thicken a sauce to put in your gravy boat by simply stirring flour into the simmering liquid, you'll end up with lumps. The starch around each lump of powder expands and forms a gel that prevents granules from separating. Luckily, there are easy methods to help prevent lumpy sauces! They also help eliminate any unpleasant raw-flour taste that can occur if sauce isn't simmered long enough. The following are methods commonly used to prep flour or starch before you use it as a thickener:</p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Beurre Manie</h3>
<p>Equal parts flour and soft, pliable butter, these two ingredients are kneaded together until every flour particle is coated with the fat, creating a dough ball known as beurre manie. This thickening agent is perfect for adding shine and viscosity to your sauces, soups, and stews. </p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Liaison</h3>
<p>Used only for slightly thickening custards or sauces, liaisons are made by tempering 1/3 of your hot mixture / sauce to a stainless steel bowl of whipped egg yolks and cream. Constantly whisk this so the eggs and cream do not curdle. Once homogenous, add the entire contents of the bowl back to the entire mixture / sauce and keep whisking until the sauce turns slightly thicker. Using the liaison method also gives your sauces a richer, creamier texture and mouthfeel. </p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Roux</h3>
<p>As a liquid thickening agent, a roux is a perfect way to add viscosity to various soups and sauces, especially four out of the<strong><span> </span>five Mother Sauces<span> </span></strong>used in the French cuisine. Equal parts flour and fat are whisked in a hot pan until smooth, and then cooked to either a white, blond, or brown roux depending on desired caramelization and depth. Gluten free flours can be used in place of the more common flours to offer more options for your gluten sensitive patrons. </p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Slurry</h3>
<p>Using starches such as cornstarch, arrowroot powder, and the like require more than simply adding the powder to your batch of soup. If added straight to the pot in this way, the starch will quickly clump up and not homogenously disperse throughout your dish. To combat this, you must first make a slurry. In a small bowl, add an equal amount of starch and cold liquid together and smooth out until a paste forms, creating the slurry. Whisk your slurry into the hot, simmering liquid that you wish to thicken and bring to a boil. Keep whisking and boiling simultaneously until there is no longer a starch taste. </p>

<h3>Pure Food Thickening Starches</h3>
Pure starches have greater thickening power and add less color to a final dish, making them ideal for sauces, puddings, and fillings. Gluten-free thickeners have become an emerging trend for food allergy-conscious bakeries and restaurants. Thickening starches are particularly important in<span> </span><b>gluten-free baking</b><span> </span>because they mimic the "sticky" effects of gluten and create a pleasant texture in baked goods. Luckily, many pure starch and leavening ingredients are naturally gluten free! Just be sure to check nutrition info for ingredients containing these variations of wheat: barley, durum, faro, malt, Matzoh, oats, rye, semolina, spelt, and wheat (bran, flour, germ, starch, and hydrolyzed protein). Use this food thickeners list to find a starch that will be perfect for your recipe!</div>

<h3><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/food-thickeners?constraint=potato-starch" target="_blank" title="Potato Starch" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potato Starch</a></h3>
<p>Potato starch is just as its name suggests: starch that is extracted from potatoes. As an amazing thickening and binding agent, it is ever popular in many gluten-free recipes. With a low gelatinizing temperature, relatively colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and a strong binding texture, it is no wonder that potato starch is used for cooking and baking applications alike.</p>

<h3><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/food-thickeners?constraint=tapioca-sabudana" target="_blank" title="Tapioca Starch" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tapioca Starch</a></h3>
<p>Extracted from the cassava plant, tapioca starch is a very fine, starchy, white powder that is a great thickening agent for food. Slightly sweet, tapioca starch is sometimes used in place of cornstarch, potato starch, and even wheat flour in gluten-free baking! Tapioca starch gives baked goods a crispy crust and chewy center, and is superior to arrowroot starch and potato starch.</p>

<h2>Common Leavening Agents</h2>
<p>Common leavening agents release gases that form air pockets throughout the dough or batter. As the product bakes, the gases expand and cause the product to rise. The proteins in the dough or batter then set around the air pockets to give products their rise and texture.</p>
</div>

<div class="template-text">
<h3><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/baking-powder" target="_blank" title="Baking Powder" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baking Powder</a></h3>
<p>This is a mixture of baking soda and an added acid, such as cream of tartar and/or sodium aluminum sulfate. Baking powder also contains a starch to prevent lumping and to balance chemical reactions. Once baking powder is in contact with liquid, it reacts quickly; therefore, products made with baking powder must be baked soon after the powder is added to prevent carbon dioxide escaping from batter or dough.</p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/baking-soda" target="_blank" title="Baking Soda" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baking Soda</a></h3>
<p>(Sodium bicarbonate): This alkaline compound (base) will release carbon dioxide gas if both an acid and moisture are present. When heated during baking, the carbon dioxide expands to give baked goods their characteristic texture known as "crumb." Heat is not necessary for this reaction to occur; therefore, products made with baking soda must be baked at once to prevent carbon dioxide escaping from batter or dough.</p>
<p>Acids commonly used with baking soda are buttermilk, sour cream, lemon juice, honey, molasses, and fruits high in acid such as citrus.</p>

<h2>How to Store Thickening Agents</h2>
<p>The best way to store thickening agents is by keeping them in an<span> </span><strong>air tight container</strong><span> </span>in a cool, dry place. If not promptly used, most thickeners (especially powder) can deteriorate, especially from heat. If they absorb moisture from the air, they can lose their effectiveness. Be sure to check individual labels for storage instructions.</p>

      <![CDATA[To remain operable during coronavirus quarantines, restaurants have<span> </span><strong>established delivery services</strong><span> </span>and adjusted their business models. As the foodservice industry adapts to the new normal imposed by COVID-19, many restaurant owners are asking, “what supplies do I need for a pandemic?”
<p> </p>
<p>Create a dining environment your customers are comfortable patronizing with our coronavirus supplies checklist, so you can safely and successfully<span> </span><strong>reopen your restaurant.</strong></p>
<h2>1. Personal Hygiene Supplies</h2>
<img class="article-img article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/6/corona-supplies-hand-sanitizer.jpg" alt="Person using hand sanitizer">
<p>Frequent handwashing with soap is the most effective way to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. However,<span> </span><strong>workplace hygiene</strong><span> </span>efforts alone will not safeguard your business from COVID-19. You need to make sure employees aren’t reporting for their shift with a fever.</p>
<p>Thermometers allow you to safely reopen and operate your restaurant. To reduce the spread of the coronavirus</p>
<p>Here is a complete list of what you need in a pandemic to ensure the personal protection of your employees and customers:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/hand-soap-sanitizers?constraint=hand-soaps" target="_blank" title="Hand Soaps" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soap</a></li>
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/hand-soap-sanitizers?constraint=hand-sanitizers" target="_blank" title="Hand Soap Sanitizers" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hand Sanitizer with an Alcohol Content of 60% or Greater</a></li>
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/hand-soap-sanitizers?constraint=disinfectant-wipes" target="_blank" title="Disinfectant Wipes" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alcohol Wipes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Coronavirus PPE Supplies</h2>
<img class="article-img article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/6/covid-supplies-worker.jpg" alt="Restaurant Chef in Uniform Wearing a Face Mask and Latex Gloves">
<p>Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a classifying term for garments that protect against bodily injuries and infections. Traditional<span> </span><strong>restaurant emergency supplies</strong><span> </span>include PPE that shield employees and customers from falling debris and unbreathable air; whereas coronavirus PPE supplies upkeep the health of your staff by barricading their bodies from microdroplets containing COVID-19. Coronavirus PPE supplies include: </p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/personal-protective-supplies?constraint=face-masks" target="_blank" title="Face Masks" rel="noopener noreferrer">Face Masks</a></li>
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/disposable-gloves" target="_blank" title="Gloves" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sterile Gloves</a></li>
<li class="icon-check"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/personal-protective-supplies?constraint=protective-aprons" target="_blank" title="Aprons" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aprons</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Face masks only remain effective when they are dry and haven't been continually adjusted by the wearer. You'll need a facemask supply that accommodates replacement whenever the mask becomes moist. At most restaurants, employees need to change their masks every four hours. However, you must honestly assess your work environment's humidity and how often your employees are called upon to speak when determining the number of masks your restaurant requires.</p>
<h2>3. Restaurant Cleaning and Sanitizing Supplies</h2>
<img class="article-img article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/6/corona-supplies-cleaning-floor-sign.jpg" alt="Person using hand sanitizer">

<div class="section">
<p>With an increasing amount of customers wanting<span> </span><strong>delivery and takeout</strong><span> </span>due to the coronavirus pandemic, online food ordering has become one of the main ways customers place orders. Customers are dining in less due to the COVID-19 restrictions, which means online ordering is a way that your business can provide for your customers’ needs.</p>
<h2>Should Your Restaurant Be Accepting Online Orders?</h2>
<p>Yes, any restaurant should, at minimum, have the option to accept customers’ online orders. The restaurant industry has seen major technological advances in the last 10 years, which makes it easier for restaurant owners to develop their online ordering system and<span> </span><strong>in-house ordering process</strong>.</p>
<img class="article-img article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/4/online-ordering_third-party.jpg" alt="Mobile Online Food Ordering">
<h2>Online Ordering Platforms for Your Restaurant</h2>
<p>Creating a restaurant online ordering platform is a lot easier than you might think. There are multiple ways you can set up an online ordering service. Thanks to food delivery apps and website forms, online ordering has gotten a lot easier.</p>
<h3>Offer a Form on the Restaurant’s Website</h3>
<p>This is one of the easiest and most common options that a restaurant can offer on their website for online ordering. When utilizing this platform, it’s important to understand how your customers want to navigate your site. Some customers looking at your restaurant’s website might be planning on dining in later and want to look at your in-house menu ahead of time, so it’s necessary to differentiate the following for online users in your website navigation:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Create a page that designates your in-house food menu</li>
<li class="icon-check">Create another page that provides your<span> </span><strong>takeout and delivery menu</strong>
</li>
<li class="icon-check">Provide a secure form that allows customers to select what food they want, make special order requests, and submit payment information</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of a Restaurant Website</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to update your menu in real time. If you run out of something, you can take it off of your delivery and takeout menu and avoid disappointing any customers</li>
<li>You can inform online users of any important company messages and update store hours and information if you unexpectedly close</li>
<li>Gives customers the capability to purchase e-gift cards</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restaurant Ordering App</h3>
<p>Made for smartphones, food apps have gained popularity among big chain restaurants to help make any customer’s takeout ordering process easier and appease the trend of mobile ordering. Panera Bread and Chick-fil-A are two examples of restaurants that have optimized the process of ordering on an app through user experience, food preparation times, and order fulfillment.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Food Ordering Apps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cuts down lines for in-house customers</li>
<li>Provides shorter wait times for online customers</li>
<li>Helps staff prioritize food orders</li>
<li>Alleviates traffic in drive-thru lines</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third Party Online Ordering</h3>
<p>Food ordering apps like Uber Eats, SkipTheDishes and DoorDash have made it easier for customers to order food directly from a mobile device. If you are curious about creating a food delivery service,<span> </span><strong>third party food delivery</strong><span> </span>will help you get your toes wet.</p>
<h4>Benefits of Third Party Food Orders</h4>
<ul>
<li>Additional delivery revenue</li>
<li>Third party delivery services provide the delivery drivers, saving you time on training and money on additional resources</li>
<li>Makes restaurant online ordering and delivery a much smoother process</li>
</ul>

<p>Hand washing is one of the most important aspects of a<span> </span><strong>restaurant’s food safety program</strong>. Without a hand washing policy in place or a strong focus on consistent training, it’s difficult to make sure your staff is following protocols. Keep reading to learn about the basics of hand washing and how to promote hand hygiene in your restaurant.</p>

<h2>Importance of Hand Washing</h2>
<p>Unwashed hands provide a vehicle for germs to travel throughout your business, and any surface or item your employees touch could become contaminated. The hand washing spotlight is often put on the kitchen staff, but hand washing hygiene isn't just a requirement for food handlers. Front-of-house employees also touch surfaces that can become sources of<span> </span><strong>cross-contamination</strong>, like drinking glasses and flatware.</p>
<p>Because the pathogens that cause foodborne illness are too small to see, hand washing remains one of the safest methods to prevent these microorganisms from spreading. Clean hands are also a good defense against COVID-19, an airborne virus that could live on surfaces like menus or door handles long enough to be transmitted from person to person. Per the CDC, this is not considered the primary way the coronavirus spreads, but a good hand washing policy is a crucial part of protecting against infection.</p>
<a id="where"></a>
<h2>Where Are You Allowed to Wash Your Hands?</h2>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/22233/508467.jpg" alt="Where to Wash Hands">
<p>Hands must be washed at designated hand washing stations that are stocked with approved hand washing soap and paper towels. The<span> </span><strong>hand sink</strong><span> </span>must provide warm running water that’s adjustable to at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and each hand washing station should be identified by a sign.</p>
<p>These requirements are meant to prevent employees from washing their hands at the wrong sink. Commercial kitchens have multiple sinks for different uses, but not all of them are suited for hand washing. For instance, a utility sink will not have paper towels or hand soap nearby and can actually be a source of contamination from dirty mop water. A pot filler sink may not have water hot enough to kill germs. If a health inspector observes a staff member washing their hands at one of these sinks instead of a hand washing sink, it could result in a<span> </span><strong>health code violation</strong>.</p>
<h3>Hand Washing Sink Regulations</h3>
<p>Commercial kitchen hand sink requirements may vary depending on your local regulatory authority, but this list can be used as a general guide when creating your hand washing stations. Stocked handwashing stations must have the following:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Location</strong><span> </span>- Hand washing sinks should be located in convenient locations throughout your restaurant, including the front-of-house and bar areas</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Usage</strong><span> </span>- Designated hand washing sinks cannot be used for any other purpose besides washing hands</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Hand soap</strong><span> </span>- Approved hand washing soap must be provided</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Hand drying</strong><span> </span>- Paper towels or hand dryers should be wall mounted within reach</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Water lines</strong><span> </span>- The sink should provide hot and cold running water</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Water temperature</strong><span> </span>- Hot and cold water should be adjustable to reach at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Touchless faucets</strong><span> </span>- Touchless faucets must run for at least 15 seconds</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Hand washing sign</strong><span> </span>- Hand washing sinks should be identified by a<span> </span><strong>hand washing compliance sign</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Wash Your Hands</h2>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/images/2020/8/how_to_wash_hands.jpg" alt="How to Wash Hands">
<p>Operators can make a big mistake by assuming their employees know how to wash their hands the right way. It seems like a simple task, but there's actually a technique that can make hand washing more effective. Demonstrate the following hand washing steps to your staff:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use warm running water to wet hands and forearms</li>
<li>Apply soap and rub hands together to build up a lather</li>
<li>Scrub hands and arms for 20 seconds (include fingertips, between fingers, and under fingernails)</li>
<li>Rinse thoroughly with warm water</li>
<li>Dry hands and arms with a clean paper towel or hand dryer</li>
<li>After washing, use a paper towel to turn off the faucet</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>You can encourage your staff to remember all the hand washing steps by posting reminders at each hand sink. A poster that lists out all the steps and includes images can be a helpful visual tool.</p>
<a id="when"></a>
<h2>When Should Food Handlers Wash Their Hands?</h2>
<p>Frequent hand washing is even more successful when it’s performed before and after certain activities. Most everyone knows it’s required to wash hands after using the restroom, but there are some not-so-obvious tasks that are also notorious for spreading germs, like handling money or touching your phone. Make sure your staff knows when to wash their hands by following this guide:</p>
<p><strong>Hands must be washed<span> </span><em>before</em><span> </span>beginning the following tasks:</strong></p>
<ul class="highlights">
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Preparing food</li>
<li class="icon-check">Handling clean dishes or utensils</li>
<li class="icon-check">Putting on clean, single-use gloves</li>
<li class="icon-check">Changing tasks</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/520378/1913010.jpg" alt="chef wearing disposable cloves and cutting raw chicken on a yellow cutting board"><br>
<p><strong>Hands must be washed<span> </span><em>after</em><span> </span>performing the following actions:</strong></p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Using the restroom</li>
<li class="icon-check">Touching your face, hair, or clothing</li>
<li class="icon-check">Handling soiled items or taking out trash</li>
<li class="icon-check">Touching raw meat, seafood, or poultry</li>
<li class="icon-check">Using cleaning chemicals</li>
<li class="icon-check">Handling money</li>
<li class="icon-check">Using the POS system</li>
<li class="icon-check">Answering the land-line phone</li>
<li class="icon-check">Touching electronic devices like mobile phones</li>
<li class="icon-check">Eating, drinking, or smoking</li>
<li class="icon-check">Touching any surface that might contaminate hands</li>
<li class="icon-check">Removing soiled, single-use gloves</li>
<li class="icon-check">Changing tasks</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Note that the correct way to wear disposable gloves is to wash hands before putting them on and after taking them off. This improves both the<span> </span><strong>effectiveness of the gloves</strong><span> </span>and prevents any chances of contamination.</p>
<a id="hand"></a>
<h2>What Is Hand Care?</h2>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/images/2020/8/hand_care.jpg" alt="Hand showing short trimmed nails with nail clippers in the background">
<p>Hand care goes beyond hand washing alone and extends to maintaining the personal hygiene of hands and nails. Restaurant employees are responsible for practicing good hand care to improve the effectiveness of hand washing policies.</p>
<h3>Hand Hygiene Guidelines</h3>
<p>Just like the guidelines surrounding clean uniforms and other forms of<span> </span><strong>personal hygiene in the workplace</strong>, there are requirements for practicing hand care.</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Fingernail length</strong><span> </span>- Keep fingernails trimmed and clean. Long nails are hard to get completely clean and provide a hiding place for germs. They can also rip gloves or chip off into food, becoming a physical contaminant.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Fake nails</strong><span> </span>- Foodservice employees should avoid wearing fake nails. They are hard to keep clean and can break off into food.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Nail polish</strong><span> </span>- To practice good hand care, employees should not wear nail polish. Dirt is hard to see underneath painted nails, and nail polish can flake off into food.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Jewelry</strong><span> </span>- Jewelry like rings and bracelets should not be worn while working in a restaurant. Dirt and contaminants can find their way beneath or inside of the jewelry. A single plain wedding band is usually allowed but all other rings should be removed during the shift.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protecting Open or Infected Wounds</h2>
<img class="article-image" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/37663/562260.jpg" alt="pointer finger with nude-colored finger cot">
<p>Accidents can happen very easily in a kitchen filled with sharp knives and hot pans. If an employee sustains an injury to their hands or arms, it's important to care for the wound properly. Open or infected wounds can become a source of contamination to food or food-contact surfaces. Follow these recommendations to protect injuries and prevent cross-contamination:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Wound on the hand or wrist</strong><span> </span>- Cover the wound with a water-resistant bandage or finger cot. Wear a disposable glove over top of the bandage.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Wound on the arm</strong><span> </span>- Cover the wound completely with a water-resistant bandage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Is a Finger Cot?</h3>
<p>A<span> </span><strong>finger cot</strong>, or finger glove, is a latex sheath that completely covers a single finger and protects a cut or wound. Foodservice employees commonly use finger cots to prevent fluids from a wound from becoming a source of contamination.</p>
<br><br>
<p>As an operator, it's your job to set the tone regarding your hand washing policy. Never assume that a new employee already knows the when, where, and how of hand washing. Make your requirements very clear from the start, provide helpful reminders, and monitor your staff to ensure they are meeting your expectations.</p>

<div class="section">
<p>Before you can<span> </span><strong>set up a delivery service for your restaurant</strong>, you need to make sure that you have a menu suitable for take out. With meal kit options booming and more customers choosing to order out rather than dining in, having a delivery-friendly menu is essential for your bottom line. As the coronavirus continues to force business closures, you can<span> </span><strong>keep your restaurant running</strong><span> </span>by offering a delivery option to your customers.</p>

<h2>Take Out Menu Considerations</h2>
<p>Whether you<span> </span><strong>use a third-party delivery service</strong><span> </span>or your own in-house delivery fleet, picking the right menu items for your take-out menu is essential for ensuring successful deliveries. It is important to understand that not every meal on your restaurant menu is delivery friendly. You’ll want to choose meals that capture the essence of your business but that can still be thoroughly enjoyed in a home setting.</p>
<p>Here are some questions you’ll want to ask yourself when deciding on a delivery menu:</p>

<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Does the meal travel well?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Will the meal get soggy or watered down with time?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Will the meal be presentable when it's delivered?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Do you have the right packaging for the meal?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Will the profit margin for the dish cover the delivery costs?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Will the prep time make total time for delivery too long?</li>
<li class="icon-check">Can your staff handle an influx of delivery meals?</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Build a Menu for Delivery</h2>
<p>Many restaurants add delivery services in efforts to<span> </span><strong>increase restaurant sales</strong><span> </span>but can end up losing income by not properly adapting their menu for delivery. To ensure that your delivery service is successful, you can choose to modify your menu dishes for delivery, specifically add delivery-friendly meals to your menu, or create a completely separate take out menu. Use the following guidelines to build your delivery menu:</p>
<h3>1. Get Your Timing Right</h3>
<p>When it comes to food delivery, timing is everything. With most customers agreeing that speed of delivering is one of their top priorities for ordering out, a speedy delivery can mean a<span> </span><strong>positive customer review</strong><span> </span>for your business.</p>
<p>These are just a few timing elements that need to be factored in when creating a delivery menu:</p>
<h4>Prep Time</h4>
<p>Before you add an item to your take out menu, be sure that it does not require extensive prep time on top of drive times. A customer may be willing to wait 20 minutes for a meal to be prepared when dining in your location, but if there is a 30-minute drive time to their home on top of prep time, this can result in excessive delivery times and a negative review.</p>
<h4>Temperatures and Textures</h4>
<p>Some foods will continue to cook even after they are packaged. For example, a steak’s internal temperature may continue to rise while in transit, causing it to arrive at a different<span> </span><strong>steak doneness level</strong><span> </span>than the customer requested or with a different texture than desired. It is important to factor total cook time into your delivery time to know when an item should be headed out the door.</p>
<h4>Delivery Radius</h4>
<img class="article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/4/delivery-fleet-section_inset.jpg" alt="Food Delivery Fleet">
<p>Create a mapped-out radius around your restaurant that your drivers can reach in an appropriate delivery time after factoring in the prep time required for your take out menu items. This way, you can ensure that all of your delivery customers have a good experience with your delivery service.</p>
<h4>Delivery Fleet</h4>
<p>Ensure that you have enough drivers in your delivery fleet to keep up with the demands of your delivery orders. It can hurt your average delivery times if you need to wait for a single driver to return from their route. You may want to hire a third-party delivery team for busier times of the year.</p>
<h3>2. Pick the Proper Packaging</h3>
<p>You may not be able to pack up your signature dishes the same way you would plate them.<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/take-out-containers-boxes" target="_blank" title="Takeout Out Containers" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Using the proper take-out containers</strong></a><span> </span>and packing up a meal correctly can ensure that your dishes arrive to your customers safely.</p>
<p>The following are just a few ways to properly pack meals for successful deliveries:</p>
<h4>Choose the Right Size Containers</h4>
<p>It's important that your meals still look presentable after they are transported. Choose to-go containers that aren’t too much larger than the item you’re packing up. For example, pizza boxes should only be a few inches wider than the pizza placed inside.</p>
<h4>Pack <a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/condiment-spreads" target="_blank" title="Condiments &amp; Sauces" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sauces and Condiments</a> Separately</h4>
<p>If you have options like nachos, salads, or loaded fries on your delivery menu, you may want to pack the sauces and condiments separately to prevent a mess when they are delivered. Keeping sauces off your dishes also keeps them from getting soggy in transit. These items can then be assembled when they arrive to your customer.</p>
<h4>Use the Proper Insulation</h4>
<p>It's important to use packaging that helps your foods retain their moisture and temperature. Hot foods that are not packaged correctly can end up releasing condensation into their containers, making your customer’s meals soggy. You can prevent that by using<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/disposable-bags?constraint=insulated-bags" target="_blank" title="Insulated Bags" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>hot food bags</strong></a><span> </span>for items like hot sandwiches and package them away from cold items like drinks to keep them from “sweating.” Be sure to also use<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/disposable-bags?constraint=insulated-bags" target="_blank" title="Insulated Bags" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>insulated food bags</strong></a><span> </span>while your orders are in transit to help them maintain the proper temperature.</p>
<h3>3. Make Your Food Presentable</h3>
<p>The way your food arrives to your customer will be the statement you make about your business. You want to make sure it looks appetizing and professional.</p>
<p>If you plate it all together, make sure it doesn’t shift around too much in transit or else it will end up looking like a mess. If you plate it separately, make sure the sauces and condiments can be easily identified so that your customer can put it together to their liking. You may need to make adaptations to the recipes of your signature dishes so they arrive in a presentable fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Adding your restaurant’s logo to your packaging</strong><span> </span>is also a great way to provide a professional final touch to your customer’s order. Having your logo or slogan on your boxes and bags can help create a memorable experience for your customers, encouraging repeat sales.</p>
<h2>Picking Your Delivery Menu Items</h2>
<p>Your best-selling menu options may not be the best choices for delivery. You can either tailor those best sellers to make them more transportable or make a delivery version of those fan favorites.</p>
<img class="article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/4/picking-your-delivery_inset.jpg" alt="Hamburgers and Pizzas in To Go Boxes">
<p>Here are some delivery-friendly meals:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Pizza</li>
<li class="icon-check">Finger foods</li>
<li class="icon-check">Sandwiches</li>
<li class="icon-check">Chinese take out</li>
<li class="icon-check">Sushi rolls</li>
<li class="icon-check">Fried chicken</li>
<li class="icon-check">Burgers</li>
<li class="icon-check">Wraps</li>
</ul>
<p>Some food items require some tweaking. These are some suggestions on how you can adapt your menu:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Instead of fresh lobster, serve lobster rolls</li>
<li class="icon-check">Instead of pancakes and eggs, serve a breakfast sandwich with pancakes as buns</li>
<li class="icon-check">Instead of bread bowls, serve soup with a roll of bread on the side</li>
<li class="icon-check">Instead of pho that is all assembled in a bowl, send the ingredients in separate containers</li>
</ul>
<p>You may want to avoid foods that are prone to melting entirely. That cake and ice cream dessert on your in-house menu should probably not come with ice cream on your delivery menu, unless you have the proper insulated containers to send it.</p>
<h2>How to Make a User-Friendly Delivery Menu</h2>
<p>Once you choose the items that are going on your delivery menu, make sure that your ordering process is simple and easy to use.</p>
<h3>1. Put Your Menu Online</h3>
<p>Most customers who are interested in ordering food for delivery will begin their search online. They will be looking for the following:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">If your<span> </span><strong>menu is available to view online</strong>
</li>
<li class="icon-check">If they can order and pay directly online</li>
<li class="icon-check">If there are any reviews for your business before they commit to the order</li>
</ul>
<p>In anticipation of your customers’ searches, try adding your delivery menu and ordering capabilities either through<span> </span><strong>your restaurant’s website</strong><span> </span>or by using a third-party delivery company’s site, Uber Eats, or DoorDash.</p>
<h3>2. Keep Your Menu Short</h3>
<p>Hungry customers typically won't have the patience to skim through a long menu of options, so it’s important to keep your delivery menu short and to the point. That means selecting a<span> </span><strong>maximum of 15 to 20</strong><span> </span>of your best-selling, easily transportable dishes for your take out menu. Once you have picked your offerings, break them up into categories to make your menu easy to navigate.</p>
<img class="article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2020/4/visually-appealing_inset.jpg" alt="Ordering Food Online with Laptop">
<h3>3. Make Your Menu Visually Appealing</h3>
<p>If your online menu is the only interaction your customer is going to have with your business, you’ll want to make sure that menu is a good representation of your restaurant. Here are some<span> </span><strong>menu design ideas</strong><span> </span>to spruce up your delivery menu:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Add professional photos</li>
<li class="icon-check">Use short and accurate food descriptions</li>
<li class="icon-check">Use enticing colors and eye-catching designs</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Update Your Menu In Real Time</h3>
<p>Nothing is more disappointing for a customer than finding out the food item they set their heart on is no longer available. This can cost you an entire sale. To prevent disappointment, designate a staff member to monitor the online menu and update it in real time depending on your supplies. If you run out of ingredients to make a menu item, immediately pull it from the menu so customers can’t accidentally order it.</p>
<br>
<p>If you have recently added a delivery service to your restaurant or are looking to add one as the foodservice industry adapts to the coronavirus, you can use these tips as a guide to structure your menu during these uncertain times.</p>

<span></span>
<div class="section">
<p>Whether you’re looking to create a smooth finish on a cake or<span> </span><strong>pipe buttercream roses</strong><span> </span>for decoration, the type of frosting you use can make a difference for the successful presentation of your baked goods. We’ll explore some common frosting types that you can use in your bakery.</p>
<p>Before you can<span> </span><strong>frost a cake</strong>, you’ll have to choose the perfect frosting to pair with your recipe. We’ve created a guide of cake frosting types to help you understand their differences and find the best one for your culinary creations.</p>
<h2><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/frosting-icing" target="_blank" title="Frosting &amp; Icing" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frosting vs Icing</a></h2>
<p>The difference between frosting and icing is that frosting is usually thick, creamy, and spreadable, while icing is typically thin, piped or drizzled on, and will harden when it cools. Frostings are usually used to thickly coat or top cakes and cupcakes, while icings are mostly used for decorations and for light sugary coatings on cookies and donuts. Both frosting and icing are staples in professional and<span> </span><strong>home bakeries</strong>.</p>

<div class="blog-highlight-wrap">
<h3>1. Buttercream Frosting</h3>
<p>Buttercream frostings rely on the main ingredient of butter and will be the most common type of frosting you will find in a bakery. Plain buttercream is also referred to as<span> </span><em>American buttercream</em><span> </span>or<span> </span><em>simple buttercream frosting</em>. Simple buttercream is considered a beaten butter frosting (which whips the butter first) as opposed to a cubed butter meringue frosting (which had butter chunks slowly added to the frosting).</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Flavor of Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Very sweet, probably the sweetest of the different types of buttercream</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Color of Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Ivory</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Texture of Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Thick and creamy; can become slightly grainy or greasy if improperly mixed; can develop thin crust over time</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Stiffness of Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Soft and pipable; can melt in warm settings and should be added to cooled sponges</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Uses of Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Pairs well with most cake sponge flavors, commonly used for<span> </span><strong>sheet cakes</strong><span> </span>and cupcakes</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Buttercream Recipe Difficulty:</strong><span> </span>Easy; requires fews tools and ingredients to make it</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Make Buttercream Frosting</h4>
<p>To make buttercream, you’ll need to combine a type of fat (typically butter or<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/shortening?constraint=shortening" target="_blank" title="Shortening" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>vegetable shortening</strong></a>) with a sweet base, usually powdered sugar (aka confectioners sugar or icing sugar). Beat room-temperature butter in a mixer until it is smooth.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mix sugar into the butter and whisk to form a smooth and airy consistency.</li>
<li>Additional flavoring can be added at this time to tailor the frosting for your recipe.</li>

<div class="blog-highlight-wrap">
<h3>2. Swiss Meringue Buttercream</h3>
<p>Swiss meringue buttercream is often just referred to as<span> </span><em>Swiss buttercream</em><span> </span>and is a cubed butter meringue frosting. This buttercream is subtle in flavor and easy to pipe, making it a great choice for more elegant bakes.</p>

<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Stiffness of Swiss Meringue Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Soft, may start to develop bubbles if left out but can be fixed by re-mixing; will melt in warm settings</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Uses of Swiss Meringue Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Frosting used for wedding cakes to achieve a perfectly white coating</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Swiss Meringue Buttercream Recipe Difficulty:</strong><span> </span>Medium; requires the use of a stove, mixer, and<span> </span><strong>candy thermometer</strong>; it can curdle or separate if made incorrectly</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Make Swiss Meringue Buttercream</h4>
<p>To make Swiss buttercream, you’ll want to separate egg whites to form the meringue base. Make sure the eggs are room temperature and that no yolks end up in the mixture. Yolks may impact its ability to fluff up. Always make sure your mixing bowl and whisk are completely clean before you start.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the egg whites and sugar.</li>
<li>Cook the sugar and egg mixture in a<span> </span><strong>double boiler (aka bain marie)</strong><span> </span>and whisk it until the mixture reaches 160 degrees Fahrenheit or until all of the sugar granules have dissolved.</li>
<li>Whisk the cooked mixture in your mixer until you achieve stiff peaks and it is room temperature.</li>
<li>Once the meringue is cooled, add room-temperature butter, one tablespoon at a time while mixing.</li>
<li>Keep mixing until you achieve stiff peaks again.</li>

<div class="blog-highlight-wrap">
<h3>3. Italian Meringue Buttercream</h3>
<p>Italian meringue buttercream or<span> </span><em>Italian buttercream</em><span> </span>is a cubed butter meringue frosting and a staple in the cake baking industry because it is less prone to melting in warmer climates. The taste and texture make it a go-to option for bakers catering upscale events.</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Flavor of Italian Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Mild buttery sweetness; can be easily flavored to complement your sponge</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Color of Italian Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>White</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Texture of Italian Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Creamy, smooth, and silky</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Stiffness of Italian Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Highly stable; will hold up relatively well in warmer conditions</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Uses of Italian Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Smooth finish is perfect for decorating birthday cakes, wedding cakes, and pies, especially for outdoor events</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Italian Buttercream Recipe Difficulty:</strong><span> </span>Hard; considered to be the most difficult of the meringue buttercreams because of its need for accurate measurements, temperatures, and mixing speeds</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Make Italian Meringue Buttercream</h4>
<p>To make Italian buttercream, you will need a range top, mixer, and a candy thermometer. This recipe uses room-temperature egg whites only, so you’ll want to separate out the yolks. Check to make sure your mixing bowl and whisk are clean before starting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add egg whites,<span> </span><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/food-thickeners?constraint=cream-of-tartar" target="_blank" title="Cream Of Tartar" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>cream of tartar</strong></a>, and a pinch of salt to a mixing bowl and start the mixer on low, gradually increasing to medium speed.</li>
<li>Slowly add sugar to the meringue and mix until soft peaks are achieved.</li>
<li>In the meantime, heat sugar and water on a medium-high heat until the candy thermometer reaches between 235-240 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Bring your mixer to a slow speed and slowly drizzle in the sugar syrup.</li>
<li>Once the syrup is in, increase the mixer speed until you achieve soft peaks.</li>
<li>Turn off the mixer and allow the meringue to reach room temperature (you can place ice packs around the bowl to speed up the process).</li>
<li>Once at room temperature, bring the mixer to a slow speed and add a tablespoon of butter at a time, mixing until you achieve stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Add your flavoring and gently mix to incorporate.</li>

<div class="blog-highlight-wrap">
<h3>4. French Buttercream</h3>
<p>French buttercream is a cubed butter frosting and the richest of the buttercreams. Unlike Swiss and Italian buttercreams, it is not a true meringue because it uses egg yolks rather than egg whites. French buttercream and French meringue buttercream are not the same kind of frosting. French meringue buttercream is made with uncooked egg whites, sugar, and butter. Because the egg whites do not get cooked in the process, it is considered unsafe to consume unless you are planning to cook the final product or use pasteurized eggs. The details below are for French buttercream and not French meringue buttercream.</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Flavor of French Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Rich and buttery; similar in flavor to custard, but mildly sweet</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Color of French Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Yellow</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Texture of French Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Creamy, thick, and silky</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Stiffness of French Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Soft, does not hold its shape very well and will melt in warm conditions</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>Uses of French Buttercream:</strong><span> </span>Because of its soft consistency, this frosting is mainly used for fillings, cupcake frosting, and the base for fruit tarts</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<strong>French Buttercream Recipe Difficulty:</strong><span> </span>Hard; sugar temperature needs to be monitored so it doesn't get too hot and crystalize</li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Make French Buttercream</h4>
<p>When making french buttercream, you’ll want to use room-temperature egg yolks rather than the egg whites. You will need a range top, candy thermometer, and mixer to combine the ingredients.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the sugar syrup by combining the sugar with some water and heat it in a pan until it hits 240 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Mix the egg yolks and a pinch of salt on a medium speed.</li>
<li>Switch the mixer to a low speed and slowly drizzle the sugar syrup into the bowl.</li>
<li>Increase the mixer speed to medium and whisk until the mixture is room temperature.</li>
<li>Add room-temperature butter to the bowl, one tablespoon at a time, while mixing.</li>
<li>Finish by adding flavouring.</li>

<h3>5. German Buttercream</h3>
<p>German buttercream is a beaten butter frosting and can also be referred to as<span> </span><em>custard buttercream</em><span> </span>or<span> </span><em>pastry-cream butter</em>. The unique recipe is rare in the bakery scene but can be a great change of pace over a traditional buttercream.</p>

<h4>How to Make German Buttercream</h4>
<p>To make German buttercream, you will first need to make the rich pastry cream or custard that serves as the base of the frosting. This recipe uses whole eggs, unlike most buttercream recipes which usually just use the whites or yolks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a saucepan, start by heating milk to a simmer over a medium heat and steeping any additional flavors you are looking to add.</li>
<li>Whisk the cornstarch (or flour), sugar, and room-temperature eggs on a medium speed in a mixer.</li>
<li>Slowly add half of the simmered milk into the egg mixture while whisking.</li>
<li>Transfer the egg mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk over a medium-low heat and bring the mixture to a boil as you whisk.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to low and whisk for approximately 2 more minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer the custard to a shallow pan and spread it out to cool.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, beat butter on a medium-high speed until fluffy.</li>
<li>Add one tablespoon at a time of custard into the whipped butter while the mixer is running until it is fully incorporated.</li>
</ol>

<li>Add the smooth mascarpone cheese into the whipped cream and give it a few mixes on low.</li>
<li>Finish by folding the frosting by hand until uniform.</li>

<h2>Choosing Food Handling Gloves</h2>
<div class="image pull-right"><img alt="Glove rack holding four boxes of powdered and powder-free latex gloves" src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/extra_large/76793/441613.jpg"></div>
<h3>What Are Food Grade Gloves?</h3>
<p>Food grade gloves contain materials that are generally considered safe for use with food and food packaging. Many types of gloves fit this description, but nitrile is a great material choice because it is strong and free of contaminants and additives.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Powdered Gloves</h3>
<p>Powder helps to reduce friction and sticking in gloves, making them easy to put on and take off when workers need to quickly change gloves. Plus, they are more resistant to tears and rips due to the reduced friction. Even though the powder itself is simply cornstarch, you will probably not want to choose powdered gloves for food applications due to the high potential for contamination.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Powder-Free Gloves</h3>
<p>The main benefit of powder-free gloves is that they will not leave a messy residue on workers' hands or on equipment - a necessity in most medical and foodservice settings. When determining what kind of gloves are food safe, you will typically want to go with powder-free varieties due to reduced risk of contamination. Many new types of powder-free gloves are becoming just as easy to slip on and off as their powdered counterparts, so the trade-off is minimal.</p>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Dry Pasta</h3>
<p>Dry pasta is made from semolina or "00" flour and water. These ingredients are mixed into a paste, pushed through molds, and cut into different types of pasta shapes. The noodles are then put through a drying process that extracts all the moisture. Since dry noodles do not contain moisture, there are a few benefits to buying them:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Dry Pasta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Longer shelf life than fresh noodles (can last up to two years if the packaging is unopened)</li>
<li>Can also be cooked al dente, whereas fresh pasta has a softer texture once it's been cooked</li>
<li>Best for soups, casseroles, and dishes with heartier sauces</li>
</ul>

<div class="template-text">
<h3>Fresh Pasta</h3>
<p>Fresh pasta is typically made from white flour, and eggs are substituted in place of water to provide extra moisture. These noodles are made with a pasta machine or cutter. The shaped noodles are then left out to partially dry. Once you're ready, add your fresh pasta to boiling water and cook just like dry pasta, but for less time.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Fresh Pasta</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has a fresher, more authentic, and flavorful taste</li>
<li>Faster cooking time</li>
<li>Best served with delicate sauces, olive oil, or creamy alfredo</li>
</ul>

<div id="guide-section-25" class="guide-section ">Now that you understand the difference between the various pasta types, you're faced with another decision: color. Like bread, you can also choose between white and whole wheat pasta. Tri-color pasta is also a readily available noodle type. When making your own, try adding spinach, squid ink, pumpkin or butternut squash puree, and even beetroot powder or puree to your pasta dough for an even trendier dish.</div>

<p>If you've ever looked at a recipe or Italian menu, you may have been confused by some of the vocabulary used to describe pasta. Below are some basic terms you'll run into.</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Al dente:</b><span> </span>Meaning "to the tooth" in Italian, this term refers to fully cooked pasta that is still a bit firm, which gives it an appealing texture.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Al forno:</b><span> </span>A pasta, pizza, or other Italian dish that is baked in the oven.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Alfredo:</b><span> </span>A white sauce made with cream, butter, parmesan cheese, and black pepper.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Asiago:</b><span> </span>Asiago is a popular hard Italian cheese that's used for grating. Add it to sauces or use it as a garnish.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Bolognese:<span> </span></b>Bolognese is a ragu pasta sauce native to the Bologna region of Italy. Traditionally, it contains finely chopped meats, onions, celery, carrots, and tomato paste.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Carbonara:</b><span> </span>Carbonara is a pasta dish that is made from eggs, a hard, grated cheese such as Pecorino or Parmesan, and a cured meat, traditionally guanciale.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Durum:</b><span> </span>Durum is a hard wheat that's high in protein and gluten. It also has a low moisture content and a long shelf life.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Fra diavolo:</b><span> </span>A spicy, tomato-based pasta sauce with crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Ini and Oni:</b><span> </span>If you're trying to choose between fusillini, fusilli, and fusillioni, the pasta names that end with the suffix -ini will be the smaller versions, and the pasta names that end with the suffix -oni will be the larger versions.</li>

<li class="icon-check">
<b>Semolina:</b><span> </span>Semolina flour is the course flour used to make dry pasta. Made from durum wheat, its high gluten and protein content provides great resistance and elasticity, thus giving dry pasta the ability to hold its shape when cooking.</li>
<li class="icon-check">
<b>Soffritto:<span> </span></b>This cooking term means "under-fried." Typically, vegetables are lightly fried in oil before they're added to the sauce for further cooking.</li>

<h2>Pasta Cooking Tips</h2>
When creating a pasta-based dish, it's important to prepare all other ingredients in the recipe, including sauce, vegetables, seafood, and meats, first. Since pasta is best served as soon as it's cooked, you can simply add the finished noodles to your already-prepared dish. When cooking your pasta, keep these tips in mind:<br><br>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-check">Use 4 - 6 qt. of water to every 1 lb. of pasta.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Boil water and cook pasta in a pasta cooker to eliminate the use of a colander.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Add 1 tbsp. of sea salt per 1 lb. of pasta to boiling water to add flavor to noodles.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Add 1 tbsp. of olive oil per 1 lb. of pasta to boiling water to prevent noodles from clumping together once drained.</li>
<li class="icon-check">While cooking, frequently stir pasta with a wooden spoon to prevent clumping.</li>
<li class="icon-check">If you want al dente pasta, set your timer for one minute less than the minimum cooking time specified on the package.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Immediately after the timer goes off, fish a few noodles out of the pot using a pasta server or slotted spoon to see if they're cooked al dente or soft enough for your preference. If done, drain immediately.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Rinse cooked, drained pasta in ice water to prevent it from cooking further.</li>
<li class="icon-check">Wondering how much pasta per person? Try using 2 oz. of dried pasta per person for a small course, and 4 oz. of dried pasta per person for a main course.</li>

<h2>What Is Microfiber Made Of?</h2>
<p>Microfiber is made of various types of polyester, polyamide, and polypropylene fibers, which are woven together to form textiles like towels, mats, apparel, upholstery, and cleaning products.</p>
<p>Many people like to use microfiber cloths when cleaning different surface types because of their ability to grab more dirt versus smearing dirt around, like cotton cloths. You can purchase a variety of microfiber cleaning products like mop heads, rags, and dusters to make cleaning much easier.</p>
<h2>How to Wash Microfiber Towels</h2>
<p>The best way to clean microfiber cloths is to hand wash them, but if you are short on time or have a large batch of microfiber cloths that need to be cleaned, here’s an easier way for you to clean them.</p>
<h3>Washing Microfiber Towels in a Washing Machine</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fill a large container with warm to hot water or as tolerable as you can stand</li>
<li>Add in a smaller amount of mild detergent than you would with an actual load of laundry (any normal laundry detergent will work)</li>
<li>Agitate water with your hands before adding in microfiber towels</li>
<li>Shake each towel individually to remove debris and place towels in your plastic bin or container and fully submerge underwater</li>
<li>Agitate again to help detergent sink into the fibers</li>
<li>Soak for 20 minutes</li>
<li>Rinse each towel under clean water</li>
<li>Wring out any extra water and lay out to air dry</li>

<h2>Why Switch to Styrofoam Alternatives?</h2>
<div class="image pull-right"><img alt="Bare by Solo HC8SC-2050 Eco-Forward 8 inch x 8 inch x 2 5/8 inch Sugarcane / Bagasse Take-Out Container - 300/Case" src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/medium/561213/2019591.jpg"></div>
<p>Styrofoam is a trademarked material that is commonly used to classify all types of expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam products. Polystyrene products are recyclable and are<span> </span><b>marked with the recyclable number "6"</b>. However, these products are very rarely actually recycled. Few local governments accept Styrofoam products in curbside recycling bins, and there are few recycling centers that accept and recycle Styrofoam because it can be a difficult and costly process. As a result, Styrofoam has become a major environmental problem for a few reasons:</p>
<ul class="highlights">
<li class="icon-cancel">Styrofoam is not biodegradable, meaning it does not naturally degrade over time, and it takes up an estimated 1/3 of the world's landfill space.</li>
<li class="icon-cancel">Oftentimes, polystyrene foam products will break down into smaller pieces that pollute the land and waters, which pose threats to wildlife and make cleanup efforts difficult.</li>
<li class="icon-cancel">Studies suggest that styrene, polystyrene foam's main ingredient, is likely a human carcinogen that can cause health problems with long-time exposure.</li>
</ul>
<p>While Styrofoam, or foamed polystyrene, may be a cost-effective solution for your take-out service, it is it is largely detrimental to the environment.. it may be helpful to reduce your dependency on these products now to stay ahead of the trend. Thankfully, there are several eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives at a range of price points that can help reduce your business's carbon footprint and appeal to a wider customer base.</p>

<h2>The Different Coffee Roasts</h2>
Coffee roasting is a heating process that brings out the aroma and flavor locked inside a green coffee seed, which has a mild, grassy taste on its own, and turns the beans brown. The flavor profile of a bean's roast level will depend on the varietal and geographic location of that bean as well as the roasting method.</div>

<h2>Types of Coffee Beans</h2>
<p>There are two basic types of coffee bean species that are grown commercially throughout the world: Coffee Arabica and Coffee Robusta, which differ due to their growing environments, overall flavor, and price. It's helpful to understand the difference between these types of coffee beans when choosing your coffee since their tastes can vary significantly.</p>
<h3>Arabica</h3>
<p>When roasted, Arabica beans provide a sweet, yet soft taste with low acidity levels. These types of coffee beans needs a cool, subtropical climate where lots of sun, rich soil, and moisture are present, as a location in a high elevation. Since Arabica beans are difficult to grow and cultivate, they are more expensive compared to Robusta beans, and have a higher cost of production. Most Arabica beans are grown in Africa and Latin America.</p>
<h3>Robusta</h3>
<p>Robusta coffee is considered the more inferior choice compared to Arabica since it yields a strong, bitter, and harsh taste when roasted. Robusta beans contain twice as much caffeine as Arabica, and therefore are less vulnerable to diseases and pests since caffeine acts as a natural insecticide in the plant. Robusta beans can also stand up to harsher growing environments and lower altitudes, making it cheaper to produce and sell. Due to its low cost, most instant and ground coffee blends sold in grocery stores are made from Robusta beans.</p>

<h2>The 16 Different Types of Butter</h2>
<p>With so many different types of butter, differentiating the color, taste, and use of each is important for finding the best butter type for your recipe.</p>
<a id="Unsalted"></a><br><img class="article-img article-img--sm article-img--left" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/buying_guide/2020/12/article-types-of-butter-unsalted-500x500.jpg" alt="Illustration of Unsalted Butter">
<div class="Unsalted">
<h3>Unsalted Butter</h3>
<p>Unsalted butter is a mildly sweet butter that’s best for baking. Because it is not salted, you’re left with the pure taste and flavors of the churned cream, so you can maintain control of the flavors in your baking recipe. Baking is an exact science, so the fat, water content, and salt levels in a butter can affect the overall outcome of a recipe. Make sure you pay attention to what butter your recipe calls for, and if you’re developing your own recipe, it’s best to stick with unsalted butter.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unsalted Butter Color:</strong><span> </span>Pale yellow</li>
<li>
<strong>Unsalted Butter Taste:</strong><span> </span>Mellow sweet cream flavor</li>
<li>
<strong>Unsalted Butter Uses:</strong><span> </span>Baking cookies, cakes, pancakes,<span> </span><strong>bread pudding</strong>, and enriched breads</li>
</ul>

<div class="Unsalted">
<h3>Salted Butter</h3>
<p>Salted butter has about 1/4 teaspoon of salt added for every 4 oz. of butter. Even though it seems like a small amount, it really does make a difference in taste. The extra salt helps the flavors in your recipe pop while also maintaining the freshness of your butter for longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Salted Butter Color:</strong><span> </span>Pale yellow</li>
<li>
<strong>Salted Butter Taste:</strong><span> </span>Slightly piquant notes amongst mild cream flavor</li>
<li>
<strong>Salted Butter Uses:</strong><span> </span>Sauteing vegetables, making pasta sauce or<span> </span><strong>caramel sauce</strong>, scrambling eggs, and spreading on toast</li>

<div class="SweetCreamButter">
<h3>Sweet Cream Butter</h3>
<p>Sweet cream butter is made from just that: sweet cream, otherwise known as pasteurized fresh cream. Some types of butter are made with cultured or sour cream and have a vastly different flavor than the milder sweet cream butter. Sweet cream butter can be sold in salted or unsalted, so double-check the label and what butter your recipe calls for before purchasing.</p>

<strong>Sweet Cream Butter Color:</strong><span> </span>Ivory</li>
<li>
<strong>Sweet Cream Butter Taste:</strong><span> </span>Mildly sweet if unsalted, slightly sharper if salted</li>

<div class="CulturedButter">
<h3>Cultured Butter</h3>
<p>Cultured butter, otherwise known as artisan butter, is a type of butter that is handcrafted. After the pasteurization process, live bacterial cultures are added to the cream and left to ferment before the churning process begins. Cultured butter is produced in a very similar way to yogurt or sour cream, resulting in the same kind of tangy and acidic flavor that’s both creamy and filled with a lactic acid flavor.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cultured Butter Color:</strong><span> </span>Cream</li>
<li>
<strong>Cultured Butter Taste:</strong><span> </span>Tangy, acidic, and fuller lactic flavor</li>

<p>Clarifying butter is the process of skimming the milk solids off of melted butter while the extra water evaporates during the melting process. Once the skimming and evaporating are complete, you’re left with pure butterfat that has a higher smoke point and a richer, fuller flavor.</p>

<h3>Smen Butter</h3>
<p>Smen is a fermented Moroccan butter that has been made and used in Middle Eastern and a few North African cuisines for centuries. Before the days of refrigeration, butter needed a way to stay preserved, so a heavy amount of salt was added to melted and skimmed butter, kneaded together, and stored in an air-tight container. Traditionally, smen is buried in the ground to maintain proper temperature stability. This fermentation process brings about a strong, piquant, and cheesy flavor and aroma that is extremely desirable in cooking.</p>

<h3>Amish Butter</h3>
<p>Amish butter is made from fresh cow’s milk that has been slowly hand-churned to a milky perfection. It is then scooped and hand-rolled into one or two-pound logs and sealed off in parchment paper. Typically, Amish butter is made from Amish family-owned and operated farms, but be careful of big manufacturing companies that market their butter as Amish butter to make a larger profit.</p>

<h2>How Butter Is Made</h2>
<p>Butter is made by churning milk or cream until the fat separates from the buttermilk. The buttermilk is strained away from the butter and is then formed into the desired shape, packaged, and sold. Instead of discarding the buttermilk, it's saved and packaged to sell in grocery stores.</p>
<h2>How to Soften Butter</h2>
<p>There are five easy and effective ways to soften butter:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Leave out on the counter:</strong><span> </span>If you remember ahead of time that your recipe calls for softened butter, set the butter out on your counter for one to two hours in indirect sunlight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cut into pieces:</strong><span> </span>Take your butter block and either slice or dice the butter into pieces. The smaller the size of the pieces, the more quickly they will soften. Place in direct sunlight for 20-30 minutes until softened.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cut with a cheese grater:</strong><span> </span>For the smallest pieces possible, running your butter along the bigger holes of a box or cheese grater easily cuts up the butter and cuts down on softening time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pound with a rolling pin:</strong><span> </span>With one sheet of wax or parchment paper, place your butter block on top of the paper, and place another piece of wax or parchment paper on top. Grab a rolling pin and pound on the butter until the entire block is about 1/4” thick.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cover with a bowl:</strong><span> </span>Find a glass bowl that’s big enough to cover your butter. Bring water to a boil and add boiling water to the glass bowl. Let the water sit in the bowl for 1-2 minutes. Dump the water out and turn the glass bowl over so it sits around the butter. Leave for two minutes or until the butter is softened.</li>
<li>
<strong>Soften in Microwave:</strong><span> </span>Switch the microwave to the lowest wattage setting. Take the amount of butter that's needed out of the packaging and place it on a plate. In 5-10 second intervals, heat the butter in the microwave. Turn the butter to a new side after every heating interval. Be careful not to overheat as the butter will melt and be sure to check the consistency of the butter after every heating interval.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Butter for Baking</h2>
<p>The best butter for baking is unsalted butter. Whether that unsalted butter comes in the form of sweet cream, European-style, organic, grass-fed, cultured, plant-based, Amish, or browned butter, any of these options that remain unsalted are great for baking. When butter is unsalted, it allows you to control the taste and salt levels rather than using a pre-salted butter.</p>
<div class="Cooking">
<img class="article-img article-img--sm article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/buying_guide/2020/12/article-types-of-butter-best-cooking-butter.jpg" alt="Butter melting in a cast iron skillet with herbs">
<h2>Best Butter for Cooking</h2>
<p>The best butter for cooking is simple: anything that’s solid. The more complicated answer? Depends on what you’re cooking. There are a lot of different types of butter that hold different flavors, salt levels, and smoke points, and while these usually do not matter most of the time, they can sometimes affect the flavor or cooking application of your dish.</p>
</div>
<h2>Does Butter Go Bad?</h2>
<p>Unsalted butter should only be left out for up to six hours at room temperature. Salted butter at room temperature can last for a few days, as the added salt helps preserve the butter. In the refrigerator, unsalted butter can last for a little over a month, while salted butter can last for a couple of months, again, because of the salt’s preserving nature. Unsalted and salted butter can last in the freezer for about six months. Past these dates, the oil in the butter can turn rancid and can even grow mold.</p>
<div class="Difference">
<br><img class="article-img article-img--sm article-img--right" src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/buying_guide/2020/12/article-types-of-butter-white-yellow-butter-difference.jpg" alt="Chocolate croissants next to butter, a wooden rolling pin, and a whisk">
<h2>What’s the Difference between White and Yellow Butter?</h2>
<p>The difference between yellow butter and white butter is the beta-carotene levels that are present. Cows that are grass-fed will typically have higher beta-carotene levels, and will therefore produce a more yellow butter. Cows that are fed hay and grains will have lower beta-carotene levels, and will therefore produce white butter.</p>
</div>
<br><hr>
<p>With so many different types of butter, finding the best one to complement your recipe is as fun as putting in the last piece of the puzzle. Gather all of your ingredients and map out your cooking applications, then choose the style of butter you’ll need from there. In the end, the butter will meld the flavors into one perfect bite after another, leaving your taste buds curious with the desire to test out all of the different kinds of butter.</p>

<span size="4" style="font-size: large;"><span size="4" style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #404040;"> While the idea of using a cake board to support a delicious cake seems pretty straightforward, there are actually many details and definitions that need to be understood to select the best cake board for your needs. Here we endeavor to outline exactly what a cake board is, and any other information you would need to know, so you can find the perfect product to support your desserts. </span></span></span>
<h2><span style="color: #404040;">What Is a Cake Board?</span></h2>
<span size="4" style="font-size: large;"><span size="4" style="font-size: large;"><span style="color: #404040;"> A <span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets?constraint=cake-boards" target="_blank" title="Cake Boards" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #da291c;"><b>cake board</b></a></span> is a thick piece of material designed to support cakes or even cupcakes to improve your presentation and make transportation easier. It is common to use the term "cake board" to refer to all sizes, shapes, and materials of boards that serve this purpose, but the below terms are used to more specifically refer to groupings of these items. </span></span></span>
<div class="template-image"><span style="color: #404040;"><img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/extra_large/428871/1596486.jpg" alt="Enjay silver cake board with a single layer white cake on top"></span></div>
<div class="template-text">
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Cake Circles:</strong> A cake circle is a round cake board that is typically thin in construction, about 1/8”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong><span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets?constraint=cake-boards" target="_blank" title="Cake Boards" style="color: #da291c;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cake Drums</a></span>:</strong> Drums refer to thicker cake boards, either 1/4" or 1/2", since they must have a double wall corrugated construction. These can also be used in between tiers of a cake for extra support.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Cake Pads:</strong> Similar to cake circles, cake pads are an economical choice designed to hold rectangular sheet cakes. These pads are also thin with a single wall corrugated construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong><span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets?constraint=single-serve-dessert-boards" title="Dessert Boards" style="color: #da291c;">Dessert Boards</a></span>:</strong> These are unique boards that have a specific function in mind. Most of them are small in size so they can hold a single cupcake or dessert.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #404040;">Terms to Know When Shopping for Cake Boards</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">These are some common terms you will come across while browsing cake boards. Your board may have none, one, or most of these features - it's completely up to you based on what is important for your application.</span><br><br></p>

<li><span style="color: #404040;"> <b><span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets" target="_blank" title="Grease Proof Cake Boards" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #da291c;">Grease-Proof</a></span>:</b> This means the material or coating of the cake board is completely impermeable to oil or grease.</span></li>

But under certain conditions, like extended time, grease may seep into the material.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;"> <b><span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets" target="_blank" title="Freezer Safe Cake Boards" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #da291c;">Freezer Safe</a></span>:</b> This means you can confidently store your cake on the board in your freezer or refrigerator for extra versatility.</span></li>

<li><span style="color: #404040;"> <b><span style="color: #da291c;"><a href="https://bulkmart.ca/collections/cake-boards-sheets" target="_blank" title="Laminated Cake Boards" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #da291c;">Laminated</a></span>:</b> Having a laminated coating helps protect the board against grease, and it also adds extra shine to the color of the board.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;"> <b>Uncoated:</b> Most cake boards come coated to prevent grease from absorbing into the cardboard. However, uncoated boards are also useful as they can support food like pizza during transport to purposefully absorb grease so it doesn't leak through the delivery box. You can also use uncoated boards if you want to add your own custom coating.</span></li>

<h2><span style="color: #404040;">Cake Board Materials</span></h2>
<span style="color: #404040;"> While we are mostly concerned with disposable cake boards in this guide, it is still important to know what materials make up both disposable and reusable cake boards.</span>
</div>
<div id="guide-section-5" class="guide-section textimage-left-template">
<div class="flex-container">

<div class="template-text">
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Corrugated Cardboard:</strong> The majority of all disposable cake boards are made of corrugated cardboard. This material consists of layers of fluted paper pressed between two outer layers, with the outer layers providing rigidity and the fluted paper providing insulation and thickness. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Laminated Chipboard:</strong> Chipboard is made of pressed paperboard, so it is lightweight while remaining fairly sturdy. It has a laminated finish to prevent grease from seeping into the material. This material is only strong enough to support smaller desserts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Foam:</strong> Cake boards can also be made of dense foam, which is naturally resistant to grease. The foam material would still need to be covered, and you should be careful not to cut into the foam if you intend to cut your cake on the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><strong>Masonite:</strong> Made of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), this material is a reusable option for your cakes. It needs to be covered in foil, wrap, or fondant before each use to protect against grease. Due to this inconvenience, these boards are often only used between cake tiers to provide structural support.</span></p>
<div id="guide-section-6" class="guide-section ">
<h3><span style="color: #404040;">Styles of Corrugated Cardboard</span></h3>
<span style="color: #404040;"> All corrugated cardboard cake boards also have an additional style to consider as it affects not only the appearance, but the use of the board as well. Check out these styles when considering using a corrugated cardboard cake board.</span>

<p><span style="color: #404040;">As the name implies, this style simply has two layers of corrugated material, instead of one. This additional material adds extra rigidity so they can support larger, heavy cakes. These boards have a thickness of 1/4” – 1/2”.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #404040;">Purely decorative, having an embossed style on your cake boards helps them stand out. Cake boards should never outshine their cake, so the subtle addition of an embossed design is the perfect middle ground.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #404040;">Common Questions When Using Cake Boards</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>What size cake board do I need?</b></i> When acting as a base for your cake, you should allow for about 2" - 4" of clearance on each side of your cake. So, your cake board should be 4" - 8" larger than your cake. For cake drums that are used in between tiers, they should be the same size as your cake.</span><br><br><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>Can I cut a cake board to the size I need?</b></i> Yes you can, just be sure to use heavy-duty scissors or another sharp tool to avoid frayed or jagged edges.</span><br><br><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>Can I use a cake board with a cake box?</b></i> Yes! In fact, you should always use a cake board when putting a cake into a box since cake boxes are prone to bending under the weight, so without the support of the cake board your cake would bend as well.</span><br><br><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>Why are the actual dimensions of my cake board slightly smaller than expected?</b></i> To make it easy to pair cake circles with their appropriate boxes, some items are commonly listed as being the same size as the cake box. However, to allow them to fit inside the cake box, their actual measurements will be slightly smaller than the box itself.</span><br><br><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>Should I put my cake on the board before or after icing?</b></i> Either way works. If you place the cake on the board before icing, then you don't need to worry about messing up your decorations by transferring it later.</span><br><br><span style="color: #404040;"><i><b>Do you have to use cake boards when stacking cakes?</b></i> If you're stacking any heavy cake, or any cake larger than 6" in diameter, you absolutely should use a board or drum between the tiers. Even with smaller cakes, it is recommended to use them if you intend to stack more than two tiers.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #404040;">How to Cover a Cake Board with Fondant</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">When dealing with uncoated cake boards, you may want to cover your board in fondant to add a specific color or texture that you simply can't get from foil or laminated boards. Follow these simple steps to add a colorful addition to the base of your delicious cakes. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #404040;">Roll out fondant to a 3mm - 4mm thickness and 1/2" wider than the cake board.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;">Brush the cake board with piping gel.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;">Lay the fondant over the cake board and use a fondant smoother to flatten the fondant completely. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;">Cut around the bottom edges of the cake board to get rid of any excess fondant. Smooth rough edges with your fingers. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #404040;">Let it sit to dry for 2 - 3 days.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #404040;">Now you are ready to display your beautiful cake on an equally attractive cake board!</span></p>

      <![CDATA[<font size="4"><p><span>While wax paper and parchment paper are similar, there are a few key distinctions that you should know before using them. Lining your sheet pans with the wrong paper could turn your baked goods into an unappetizing mess and may even start a fire. Keep reading to see which mistakes can cause hazards in your kitchen and to learn what each type of paper is designed to do.</span></p>
<h2>The Difference Between Wax Paper and Parchment Paper</h2>
<p><span><img src="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/uploads/blog/2017/6/chicken.jpg" class="article-image" alt="wax paper for serving food"></span></p>

<p>If you’re unsure of the difference between wax paper and parchment paper, refer to the information below for their definitions and available forms. </p>
<h3>Wax Paper </h3>
<p>Wax paper is paper that has been coated with a soybean-based or paraffin wax in order to become non-stick and resistant to changes in moisture. It helps to keep water in or out, so juicy foods stay moist and crunchy foods don’t get soggy. As a result, wax paper is excellent for both storing and presenting food.</p>
<h3>Parchment Paper </h3>
<p>Parchment paper is paper coated in silicone or Quilon to create a non-stick and heat-resistant surface. It generally comes in two styles: bleached parchment paper, which is a translucent white color, or unbleached parchment paper, which is translucent tan.</p>
<p>Parchment paper comes in rolls, rectangular sheets, and circular sheets.</p>

<h2>Wax Paper vs. Parchment Paper for Baking</h2>
<p>Wax paper is not safe to put in the oven. The wax coating on the paper can melt or even ignite, so it is not a suitable non-stick barrier when using heat from any source. However, parchment paper is safe to use while baking and cooking because its silicone coating is heat resistant. For this reason, parchment paper is excellent for lining baking sheets and cake pans. In fact, you can even bake foods<span> </span><i>en papillote</i>, or enclosed in a packet of parchment paper, to retain moisture in the oven. Similarly, cooking foods<span> </span><i>a cartouche</i><span> </span>uses parchment paper to cover food while simmering or poaching on the stove.</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Wax Paper vs. Parchment Paper for Freezing</h2>
<p>Both wax paper and parchment paper can be used for freezing. For example, fold the paper to wrap fruits and vegetables, or use precut sheets as barriers between stacked cuts of meat. You can also write on either type of paper with permanent marker to label your foods and keep track of what you are chilling. </p>
<p>While cool temperatures do not affect either of these papers’ coatings, some professionals prefer to use wax paper in the freezer because it is more economical than parchment paper, and they choose to reserve parchment paper for heating only.</p>
<h2>Wax Paper vs. Parchment Paper for Food Preparation</h2>
<figure class="article-image"><a href="https://www.webstaurantstore.com/447/wax-paper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://cdnimg.webstaurantstore.com/images/products/large/183066/1124854.jpg" alt="Wax Paper"></a>

<p>Wax paper and parchment are also useful in various food preparation processes. You can put either type of paper down on your work surfaces and discard it when you are done, so cleanup is fast and easy. This is especially useful if you are working with sticky foods like ground meat, dough, or pasta. If you are making a recipe with sifted dry ingredients, simply place a sheet of wax or parchment paper on your surface and sift the ingredient over the paper. Then, carefully pick up the paper and funnel the ingredient into your mixture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Wax paper and parchment paper can be used for a variety of kitchen tasks, but it is important to remember that wax paper is not heat safe. These versatile papers come in several forms and can help you save on cleanup time, keep your foods fresh, and even simplify your preparation processes. </span></p></font>]]>
