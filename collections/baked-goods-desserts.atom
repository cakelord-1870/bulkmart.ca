<h2 class="headline">Put the cherry on top of your signature desserts with these maraschino cherries with stems.</h2>
<p><span>Featuring a vibrant red color, these maraschino cherries are sure to brighten up your menu items and bring something new to the table. These cherries have their stems left on to add a more natural-looking decoration to your offerings. The bulk gallon jar ensures that there's plenty for you to use to match the color scheme of your next holiday display or special event.</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Delicious Flavor</h3>
<p>These cherries boast a crisp, sweet flavor and soft texture, making them a must-have topping for your restaurant, bar, ice cream shop, or bakery.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Resealable Container</h3>
<p>To ensure optimum freshness, these cherries are picked at the peak of ripeness and packed in a hermetically sealed gallon container.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Versatile Ingredient</h3>
<p>With their ruby red coloring and plump, juicy flesh, cherries are an excellent ingredient in a variety of desserts and cocktails. They're famous in pineapple upside down cakes, topping off any sundae, or garnishing a cocktail. With their juice, craft Shirley Temples or other cherry juice-based beverages. Plus, the juice can act as a natural food coloring dye, giving a beautiful pink hue to cake batters, housemade ice cream, and even gourmet marshmallows.</p>
