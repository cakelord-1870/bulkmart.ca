<h3 class="item-header">Delicious Flavor</h3>
<p>These cherries boast a crisp, sweet flavor and soft texture, making them a must-have topping for your restaurant, bar, ice cream shop, or bakery.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Resealable Container</h3>
<p>To ensure optimum freshness, these cherries are picked at the peak of ripeness and packed in a hermetically sealed gallon container.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Versatile Ingredient</h3>
<p>With their ruby red coloring and plump, juicy flesh, cherries are an excellent ingredient in a variety of desserts and cocktails. They're famous in pineapple upside down cakes, topping off any sundae, or garnishing a cocktail. With their juice, craft Shirley Temples or other cherry juice-based beverages.
