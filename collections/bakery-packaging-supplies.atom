<a>
<p itemprop="description">Showcase every layer of your bakery, restaurant, or grocery store's cakes and pies with this Polar Pak 503230 5" clear plastic hinged container. This container's high dome lid is great for slices of mile-high pies, meringue pies with a heavy layer of whipped toppings, and layer cakes. Use this container's crystal clear lid to set up eye-catching displays. Then use its efficient design to enable your bakery or grocery store's customers to select containers and carry them home with ease.<br><br>Made of durable polyethylene (PETE) plastic with wide ribbing along the sides for added strength, this plastic protects your baked goods. It's resistant to water and oxygen, and does not transmit exterior odors to food products. Plus, this container's durability enables you to stack containers for compact presentation and transportation. Meanwhile, this triangular container's rounded corners prevent your crusts from crumbling after slightly bumping into the edge.<br><br>This container's hinged lid and one round lock tab ensures the lid remains securely sealed, but also opens effortlessly. The open tab is located on the front tip of the container, incorporating it into the triangular design.
