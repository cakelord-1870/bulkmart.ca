<p><strong>KD - Kosher- Dairy</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In many kitchen today, staff is scarce and there’s only 24 hours in a day. So making caramels from scratch is not always an option. With Callebaut’s Caramel, that changes: you can count on a genuine, great tasting caramel made with the best ingredients and without any artificial flavours or colourings. It has a deep &amp; bold caramel taste and golden-brown colour, typical for home-made caramels. And the best part: it’s there, close at hand, without increasing the workload of your staff!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><br><span>Our chefs elaborated the caramel recipe in such a way that it's easy to work with and allows you to use for anything from filling in bonbons to topping your desserts. It has a short tail for perfect piping in small delicacies such as bonbons or bars. And it’s firm enough to be perfectly versatile to also top cakes, pastries and desserts or flavour your creams and crémeux. Moreover, the new caramel is easy to tune with your own personal touch: mixing in fleur de sel or crunches, or mixing with chocolate to create chocolate fudge. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Essential for any bakery</strong>, chocolate shop, or restaurant and cafe that uses the finest products, this chocolate is more than an ingredient: it is the multi-dimensional element that takes your recipe to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Temper this chocolate to create the perfect set, snap, and shine to coat</strong> your truffles, fresh fruits, or to create chocolate masterpieces to adorn cakes or make into showpieces. Melt the chocolate to use as an ingredient when baking airy souffles, spongy cakes, rich ganache, silky pastry cream, or smooth ice cream.</span></p>
<p><span>Or, roughly <strong>chop this bar for the ultimate chocolate chunks to fold into your batters for signature, premium baked goods</strong>. Plus, as a bulk chocolate bar, your business will always be in good supply with premium chocolate for your high-quality confections.</span></p>
<p><span>Callebaut's new Caramel Loaf is the perfect ingredient to add a savour butter toffee flavour and excite the taste buds. Excellent for all dipping and drizzling applications and easy to warm up and apply to a number of delicious treats. Finally a true caramel that is ready to use! Caramel Fill is a real, dark blonde caramel, made from sugar and milk, with a heavenly butter toffee flavour. Just warm up for a few seconds before piping it in pralines, cups etc. Kosher Dairy</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Essential for any bakery</strong>, chocolate shop, or restaurant and cafe that uses the finest products, this chocolate is more than an ingredient: it is the multi-dimensional element that takes your recipe to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Temper this chocolate to create the perfect set, snap, and shine to coat</strong> your truffles, fresh fruits, or to create chocolate masterpieces to adorn cakes or make into showpieces. Melt the chocolate to use as an ingredient when baking airy souffles, spongy cakes, rich ganache, silky pastry cream, or smooth ice cream.</span></p>
<p><span>Or, roughly <strong>chop this bar for the ultimate chocolate chunks to fold into your batters for signature, premium baked goods</strong>. Plus, as a bulk chocolate bar, your business will always be in good supply with premium chocolate for your high-quality confections.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mix of 70% dark chocolate and 30% hazelnuts.</strong><br>Gianduja Dark is a smooth and creamy mix of Callebaut®'s dark chocolate and a pure hazelnut paste. The cream is mixed, conched and tempered by our Master Concher to create a lovely balanced taste, and a smooth, homogeneous texture for great mouthfeel.<br>Gianduja Dark comes a semi-solid cream that can easily be cut into confectionery delights or enrobed with chocolate.<br>After softening, it can even be piped into moulded chocolate shells, pralines or chocolate bars. After melting, it becomes a perfect base for flavouring ice cream and pastry interiors such as mousse, bavarois and crémeux. Gianduja also works wonders in flavouring desserts such as sabayon or mœlleux. </span></p>
