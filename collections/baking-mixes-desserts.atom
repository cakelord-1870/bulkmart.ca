<p><span>The gelatin choice of chefs, leaf gelatin is easy to use and measure in the kitchen. This odorless, tasteless thickening agent forms a gel when combined with liquid and heat. Leaf gelatin melts more slowly than granular gelatin but produces a gel of greater clarity. Gold leaf gelatin sets firm (200 Bloom strength) and is ideal in the preparation of jellies, mousses, marshmallows, sweet or savory bavarois and aspics. This product is derived from beef and pork products.</span></p>
