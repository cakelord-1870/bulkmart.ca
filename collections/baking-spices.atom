<div class="description" itemprop="description">Thyme or fully known as Thymus vulagaris is a low growing herbaceous plant, sometimes becoming somewhat woody. Thyme has a mighty flavour and armoa courtesy of the tindy dark green leaves. The leaves are known for their spicy and resinous aroma which add a distinctive aromatic flavoring to sauces, stews, stuffings, meats, poultry – almost anything from soup to salad.</div>
<div class="description" itemprop="description">Thyme is used in flavouring chowder, meats, sausage, cottage cheese, creamed chipped beef, creamed chicken, Creole seafood dishes, poultry dressing, tomatoes, marinades, vegetables, fish, and cheese dishes. Thyme butter is good over creamed white onions, asparagus, green beans and eggplant. Use in stews, soups and jerk blends. 1/4 tsp (1 mL) is equivalent to 1 tbsp (15 mL) fresh chopped thyme leaves. Ground spices should be added just prior to the end of cooking time, as they release their flavour quickly.</div>
