For best results when getting your sanding sugar to stick to your baked goods, let them cool completely, brush with an egg wash, and decorate with the sugar as desired.

Its orange color is great for matching your customer's event's color schemes or theme, creating festive sweets for the holidays, or simply for giving your treats a unique pop of color and glimmer! Because it is bake-stable, this sugar can be used before or after baking as the perfect finishing touch. For best results when getting your sanding sugar to stick to your baked goods, let them cool completely, brush with an egg wash, and decorate with the sugar as desired. In addition to an egg wash, icings, glazes, and melted chocolate can also be used as a foundation to the sanding sugar.</p></td>
