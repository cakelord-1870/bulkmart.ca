<h3 class="item-header">Eco-Friendly Design</h3>
<p>Made from sugarcane / bagasse material, this square takeout box is entirely compostable to reduce your establishment's environmental impact. While other disposable products are burned when thrown away causing air pollution, this can be renewed and recycled. Plus, the extremely durable material is cut and grease resistant so you can use it for a variety of foods!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Perforated Lid</h3>
<p>With an easy-to-close perforated lid, this container quickly goes from a convenient carrier to a serving dish in no time at all!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Secure Lip</h3>
<p>To prevent spillage, this disposable container boasts a secure lip along its edge. This added protection helps contain the contents by creating a tighter seal between the lid and container than traditional foam or cardboard takeout boxes.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Superior Alternative</h3>
<p>This sugarcane / bagasse item takes up less storage space than other disposable alternatives, and it can hold heavier foods than either paper or Styrofoam. Plus, since it requires much less energy to produce, it saves on both energy and resources.</p>

<p>Made from sugarcane / bagasse material, this square takeout box is entirely compostable to reduce your establishment's environmental impact.

Plus, the extremely durable material is cut and grease resistant so you can use it for a variety of foods!</p>

<p>With an easy-to-close perforated lid, this container quickly goes from a convenient carrier to a serving dish in no time at all!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Secure Lip</h3>
<p>To prevent spillage, this disposable container boasts a secure lip along its edge. This added protection helps contain the contents by creating a tighter seal between the lid and container than traditional foam or cardboard takeout boxes.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Superior Alternative</h3>
<p>This sugarcane / bagasse item takes up less storage space than other disposable alternatives, and it can hold heavier foods than either paper or Styrofoam. Plus, since it requires much less energy to produce, it saves on both energy and resources.</p>

<p><span>This compostable sugarcane / bagasse takeout box is perfect for restaurants, caterers, and sandwich shops that serve anything from hot entrees to cold salads. Package up takeout orders or leftovers for your customers while also taking a step toward going green with this environmentally smart option!</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Eco-Friendly Design</h3>
<p>Made from sugarcane / bagasse material, this square takeout box is entirely compostable to reduce your establishment's environmental impact. While other disposable products are burned when thrown away causing air pollution, this can be renewed and recycled. Plus, the extremely durable material is cut and grease resistant so you can use it for a variety of foods!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Perforated Lid</h3>
<p>With an easy-to-close perforated lid, this container quickly goes from a convenient carrier to a serving dish in no time at all!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Secure Lip</h3>
<p>To prevent spillage, this disposable container boasts a secure lip along its edge. This added protection helps contain the contents by creating a tighter seal between the lid and container than traditional foam or cardboard takeout boxes.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Superior Alternative</h3>
<p>This sugarcane / bagasse item takes up less storage space than other disposable alternatives, and it can hold heavier foods than either paper or Styrofoam. Plus, since it requires much less energy to produce, it saves on both energy and resources.</p>
