<h2>Details</h2>
<p itemprop="description">This Lipton decaffeinated green tea allows patrons to savor the great taste and benefits of green tea, without the caffeine, during any time of the day! This green tea provides a clean, fresh, non-bitter taste, a smooth, light body, and a soothing aroma. The tea leaves are decaffeinated using an all-natural process with pure spring water that gently washes caffeine away without any resulting effect on the tea's pure flavor. Not only does this tea help soothe the senses, it also contains flavonoids and other antioxidants, which can help support a healthy heart when consumed as part of the everyday diet!<br><br>These tea bags are ideal for placing at your break room's self-serve hot beverage station or hotel breakfast bar or simply offering as a tea selection on your beverage menu. Each tea bag is packaged in individual serving size envelopes, making this tea a convenient option for on-the-go customers and busy employees. The bag's easy-to-steep design provides quick preparation without sacrificing quality of flavor, color, and aroma. To prepare, simply pour boiling water over a tea bag and steep for 2 minutes. Drink plain, add a dash of milk or honey, or a simple squeeze of lemon to enjoy.</p>

<p itemprop="description">Enjoy the premium taste and aroma of loose leaf tea blends in convenient, single-serve packaging with this Pure Leaf Gunpowder green tea bag! This long-leaf tea is crafted with single-origin Indonesian green tea from the volcanic island of Java, which produces a characteristically bright and clean green tea. The tea's name is derived from the shape of its leaves, which are rolled into small, tight pellets that resemble grains of gunpowder. To prepare, simply steep one pyramid bag at 176 degrees Fahrenheit for 2-3 minutes; when steeped, the leaves will begin to unfurl to release their flavor. The result is a fresh, clean, and mildly smoky taste with a refreshingly smooth finish. This tea is perfect for upscaling your waiting room, break room, or lobby's offerings, or merchandising as a beverage selection at your breakfast buffet or in your cafe. You can also pair with other Pure Leaf tea bag flavors to offer as a thoughtful in-room amenity for guests staying at your hotel.<br><br>The tea sachet's pyramid shape and mesh design allows water to circulate around the tea leaves more easily than with traditional tea bags. This allows the tea leaves to expand, which draws out more of the flavors, fragrance, and color for a more well-rounded cup. Plus, the tea bag, strings, and tags are made with compostable, plant-based renewable materials and the cases, cartons, and envelopes are 100% recyclable.</p>

The exclusive growing conditions in the Kenyan tea estate where this long-leaf black tea is produced impart a smooth, full-bodied flavor with a unique floral bouquet that is complemented with notes of juicy berries and sweet-tart, citrusy hibiscus and rosehips. To prepare, simply steep one pyramid bag at 212 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 minutes. Once ready, it's strong enough to hold up to milk and sugar, yet smooth enough to be enjoyed on its own. This tea is perfect for upscaling your waiting room, break room, or lobby's offerings, or merchandising as a beverage selection at your breakfast buffet or in your cafe. You can also pair with other Pure Leaf tea bag flavors to offer as a thoughtful in-room amenity for guests staying at your hotel.<br><br>The tea sachet's pyramid shape and mesh design allows water to circulate around the tea leaves more easily than with traditional tea bags. This allows the tea leaves to expand, which draws out more of the flavors, fragrance, and color for a more well-rounded cup.
