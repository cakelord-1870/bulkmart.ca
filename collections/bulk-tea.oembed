Unlike decaf black tea, our refreshing tea will stimulate you and help you feel revitalized thanks to a healthy natural caffeine content. Red Rose Orange Pekoe tea is both a refreshing and bold healthy beverage option. The first ingredient in tea is water, which is needed by your body to run at its best. In fact, tea is 99.5% water. The rest of each of our Red Rose Orange Pekoe tea are black tea leaves that are 100% natural. This perfect hot drink contains no fat, no carbohydrates and no calories. So sip your Red Rose tea without any guilt. We are working with the Rainforest Alliance, an independent non-profit organization, to ensure that the tea you enjoy in your home helps improve living conditions for tea growing families and protects the environment. 100% of Red Rose tea comes from Rainforest Alliance Certified tea gardens.
