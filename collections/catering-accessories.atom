<p><span>This 10" paper cone oil filter is designed for use with 10" fryer oil cone filter holders. It's perfect for seasonal concession stands, snack bars, or sandwich shops that occasionally fry foods. The 10" paper oil filter cone is made from a 70 micron non-woven material with over-locking stitches for added strength.</span><br><br><span>Regularly filtering your fryer oil with a product like this one will help prolong the oil's life by removing contaminants that can cause off-tastes and oxidation. You'll save money since you won't have to replace the oil as frequently and will also deliver better-tasting fried foods for your customers.</span></p>
