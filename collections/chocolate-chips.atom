<p><strong>These semi-sweet mini chocolate chips</strong> are the perfect addition to any baked treat. When mixed in your favorite batter, these mini morsels provide more chocolate in every bite! Different from unsweetened or milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate is a type of dark chocolate that has its own distinct taste that uses half as much sugar as cocoa.</p>
<p><strong>Though it is not as sweet as milk chocolate</strong>, it is great for cooking and baking purposes. Adding these chocolate chips to your menu offerings provides chocolate taste that's sure to please customers of all ages. Semi-sweet chocolate features a higher concentration of chocolate liquor, which gives it an added rich and decadent taste.</p>
