<p><span>These Beans are easy to prepare and add to any dish. While commonly used for southern-style recipes, they can be used as a protein substitute for meat in soups, salsas, and gumbo to accommodate vegetarian guests. Bursting with flavor and nutritionally rich, they're sure to be a hit at your salad bar, restaurant, or catered event. Bring home-style meals to the table with these peas!</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Enhances Your Menu</h3>
<p>These legumes are perfect for enhancing buffet and restaurant menus. After rinsing and boiling them, simply toss them on top of leafy lettuce with a drizzle of dressing for a refreshing salad, bake them for a creamy side dish, or stir them into a sauce and layer it on a portion of noodles for a meatless alternative to traditional pasta.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">A Nutritious Option</h3>
<p>Rich in potassium, fiber, zinc, and vitamin A, these black eye peas are a great, low-calorie, low-fat option for health-conscious consumers. They're cholesterol free and boxed with no additives or preservatives, ensuring a fresh flavor and homegrown taste. Use these beans to expand your menu selection and create healthier dish options!</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Advantages Over Canned Beans</h3>
<p>Although dried beans and peas may take longer to cook and require a soaking process, they have many advantages. While canned peas may seem either too firm or too mushy, your staff can control the firmness of the beans as they cook them. Plus, they're cost-effective and easy to store.</p></td>
