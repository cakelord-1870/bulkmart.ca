<p><span>Add a bright, fresh-picked orange flavor to your baked goods and frostings orange bakery emulsion! Preferred by pastry chefs and bakers for their superior results, emulsions are flavorings that are suspended in a water base to deliver richer, more flavorful baked goods than alcohol-based extracts. Because water does not evaporate as quickly as alcohol when exposed to heat, this emulsion will retain its strength and won't bake-out during the baking process, resulting in foods with a richer citrus flavor and aroma. Perfect for high-heat and no-bake applications, use this versatile emulsion to bring delicious flavor to cakes, cookies, and sweet breads as well as frostings, glazes, fondants, fillings, and cream centers. You can also use it to create signature orangeades, iced teas, and cocktails for your specialty beverage menu! No matter how you choose to use it, this emulsion is sure to become an essential ingredient in your kitchen.</span></p>
