<p itemprop="description">This Millbrook gluten free potato starch will help you keep your pantry well-stocked with the essentials! Made from the starch of fresh potatoes, this dense powdery product is widely used for a variety of culinary applications. Potato starch is similar to corn starch and can be used as a replacement for corn starch in many recipes. It also has a higher heat tolerance than corn starch, making it perfect for thickening sauces, soups, and stews, in addition to puddings, pie fillings, and gravies. Use 4 tsp. of potato starch to substitute for every 1 Tbsp. of corn starch; when using it to thicken a liquid, mix the potato starch with a small amount of water to make a slurry before stirring it in to your recipe to help prevent clumping. <br><br>Beyond thickening, potato starch also has numerous uses in baking. It helps add moistness to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. It's also a key ingredient in shortbread recipes, where its fine texture produces crumbly and tender breads! Potato starch is also great for helping to produce a crispy texture in your sauteed or stir-fried meats and vegetables; coat small pieces of your desired ingredient in potato starch to produce a crispy coating. It's also the secret ingredient in the batter of extra-crispy deep fried foods! Add potato starch to the batter of your fried fish, onion rings, or any other food you want to fry up with a crispy, golden-brown coating. It's especially popular as an ingredient in crispy-yet-moist Japanese Karaage chicken. No matter how you use it, this potato starch is sure to be a key ingredient in your busy kitchen; this bulk 10 Kg supply will keep you well-stocked for all of your culinary needs!<br></p></td>

Spelt is a primitive relative of modern wheat and is one of the oldest cultivated grains; some evidence suggests that humans have been growing and eating it for as long as 8000 years. Though modern wheat has been more widely cultivated than spelt for centuries, spelt is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative to traditional wheat flours! Because it is related to wheat, spelt flour contains gluten, but the gluten proteins in spelt are more water soluble than those in wheat, making it easier to digest. This means that spelt flour should not be eaten by people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, though some people with wheat allergies and mild gluten sensitivities report that spelt is more easy to digest than flour. Its unique genetic structure also makes spelt flour a great source of protein and essential minerals including manganese, zinc, and copper! <br>Because of its similarity to wheat, spelt flour can be used in practically any recipe that calls for all-purpose or wheat flour. Spelt adds a uniquely nutty flavor and a light texture to your baked goods! Spelt can generally be substituted for 50% of the wheat flour in a recipe, though if you have not used it before, you may want to start out by substituting 25% spelt flour and working your way up as you become more familiar with it. It's especially good for use in breads, pancakes, and cookies! No matter how you choose to use it, this ancient grain will add delicious flavor and wholesome nutrition to baked goods in your restaurant, bakery or cafe.

<p><span>Add a delicious and nutritious flour to your bakery's pantry with this Millbrook brown rice flour! This flour is made from whole grain brown rice that is carefully stone ground to produce a perfect texture and preserve the nutrients found in the bran and germ of rice kernels. While some rice flours can be gritty, Millbrook brown rice flour is especially fine and produces baked goods with a delightful texture! In addition to being high in essential nutrients like protein and fiber, this brown rice flour is gluten free, so it's suitable for serving to customers with dietary restrictions.</span><br><br><span>When used alone, rice flour can be difficult to work with and may produce a dry crumbly texture in your baked goods, so it's best used in conjunction with other wheat or gluten-free flours. Oat flour, buckwheat flour, almond flour, and garbanzo bean flour are all great additions to your gluten-free flour mix! This brown rice flour will lend a light texture and nutty flavor to your breads, muffins, pancakes, or other baked goods. It's also great to use as a gluten-free thickener for soups, stews, and gravies, or a breading for fried, grilled, or sauteed foods. No matter how you choose to use it, this brown rice flour is sure to become a staple in your kitchen; this bulk 10 Kg bag will keep you in good supply for all of your culinary needs! For optimal freshness, refrigerate or freeze this flour after opening.</span></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>Millbrook - White Rice Flour Stone Ground - 10 Kg</strong></p>
<p><span>Add a delicious and versatile flour to your bakery's pantry with this Millbrook white rice flour! This flour is made from pure glutinous white rice; though its name implies that this rice variety contains gluten, it actually refers to the rice's "sticky" qualities that mimic the behavior of gluten. This product is naturally gluten free and produced in Millbrook gluten free facility, so it's suitable for serving to customers with dietary restrictions! While some rice flours can be gritty, Millbrook white rice flour is especially fine and produces baked goods with a delightful texture!</span><br><br><span>When used alone, rice flour can be difficult to work with and may produce a dry crumbly texture in your baked goods, so it's best used in conjunction with other wheat or gluten-free flours. Oat flour, buckwheat flour, almond flour, and garbanzo bean flour are all great additions to your gluten-free flour mix! This white rice flour will lend a light, delicate sponginess to your breads, muffins, pancakes, or other baked goods. It's also great to use as a gluten-free thickener for soups, stews, and gravies. No matter how you choose to use it, this brown rice flour is sure to become a staple in your kitchen; this bulk 10 Kg bag will keep you in good supply for all of your culinary needs! For optimal freshness, refrigerate or freeze this flour after opening.</span><br><br><span>A leading brand in health foods, Bob's Red Mill is dedicated to providing the best products using the Old World technique of traditional stone milling. This technique allows for the inherent nutrients and flavor of their grains to be preserved, thus providing wholesome, quality foods to your kitchen. Plus, they have a separate 100% gluten free facility where they process, package, and test all of their gluten free products, so you can always be sure you are serving your customers with allergies a safe-to-eat product.
