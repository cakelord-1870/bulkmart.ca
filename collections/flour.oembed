This product is naturally gluten free and produced in Bob's Red Mill's gluten free facility, so it's suitable for serving to customers with dietary restrictions!

Spelt is a primitive relative of modern wheat and is one of the oldest cultivated grains; some evidence suggests that humans have been growing and eating it for as long as 8000 years. Though modern wheat has been more widely cultivated than spelt for centuries, spelt is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative to traditional wheat flours! Because it is related to wheat, spelt flour contains gluten, but the gluten proteins in spelt are more water soluble than those in wheat, making it easier to digest. This means that spelt flour should not be eaten by people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, though some people with wheat allergies and mild gluten sensitivities report that spelt is more easy to digest than flour. Its unique genetic structure also makes spelt flour a great source of protein and essential minerals including manganese, zinc, and copper! Plus, like all whole grain flours, this spelt flour is high in dietary fiber, promoting healthy digestion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of its similarity to wheat, spelt flour can be used in practically any recipe that calls for all-purpose or whole wheat flour. Spelt adds a uniquely nutty flavor and a light texture to your baked goods! Spelt can generally be substituted for 50% of the wheat flour in a recipe, though if you have not used it before, you may want to start out by substituting 25% spelt flour and working your way up as you become more familiar with it. It's especially good for use in breads, pancakes, and cookies! No matter how you choose to use it, this ancient grain will add delicious flavor and wholesome nutrition to baked goods in your restaurant, bakery or cafe.

Made from the starch of fresh potatoes, this dense powdery product is widely used for a variety of culinary applications. Potato starch is similar to corn starch and can be used as a replacement for corn starch in many recipes. It also has a higher heat tolerance than corn starch, making it perfect for thickening sauces, soups, and stews, in addition to puddings, pie fillings, and gravies. Use 4 tsp. of potato starch to substitute for every 1 Tbsp. of corn starch; when using it to thicken a liquid, mix the potato starch with a small amount of water to make a slurry before stirring it in to your recipe to help prevent clumping. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond thickening, potato starch also has numerous uses in baking. It helps add moistness to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. It's also a key ingredient in shortbread recipes, where its fine texture produces crumbly and tender breads! Potato starch is also great for helping to produce a crispy texture in your sauteed or stir-fried meats and vegetables; coat small pieces of your desired ingredient in potato starch to produce a crispy coating. It's also the secret ingredient in the batter of extra-crispy deep fried foods! Add potato starch to the batter of your fried fish, onion rings, or any other food you want to fry up with a crispy, golden-brown coating. It's especially popular as an ingredient in crispy-yet-moist Japanese Karaage chicken.
