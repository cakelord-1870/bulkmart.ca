<p itemprop="description">This Millbrook gluten free potato starch will help you keep your pantry well-stocked with the essentials! Made from the starch of fresh potatoes, this dense powdery product is widely used for a variety of culinary applications. Potato starch is similar to corn starch and can be used as a replacement for corn starch in many recipes. It also has a higher heat tolerance than corn starch, making it perfect for thickening sauces, soups, and stews, in addition to puddings, pie fillings, and gravies. Use 4 tsp. of potato starch to substitute for every 1 Tbsp. of corn starch; when using it to thicken a liquid, mix the potato starch with a small amount of water to make a slurry before stirring it in to your recipe to help prevent clumping.Â <br><br>Beyond thickening, potato starch also has numerous uses in baking. It helps add moistness to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. It's also a key ingredient in shortbread recipes, where its fine texture produces crumbly and tender breads! Potato starch is also great for helping to produce a crispy texture in your sauteed or stir-fried meats and vegetables; coat small pieces of your desired ingredient in potato starch to produce a crispy coating. It's also the secret ingredient in the batter of extra-crispy deep fried foods! Add potato starch to the batter of your fried fish, onion rings, or any other food you want to fry up with a crispy, golden-brown coating. It's especially popular as an ingredient in crispy-yet-moist Japanese Karaage chicken. No matter how you use it, this potato starch is sure to be a key ingredient in your busy kitchen; this bulk 10 Kg supply will keep you well-stocked for all of your culinary needs!<br></p></td>

<p><span>This must-have item is a staple in any restaurant's kitchen. Many people prefer to use corn starch as a thickening agent since it dissolves clearly, and doesn't alter the color or appearance of dishes. However, corn starch does clump when added to hot liquids or mixtures, and should therefore be added in small quantities.</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Flavorless Thickener</h3>
<p>A nearly flavorless thickener, it's great for thickening a variety of recipes, including gravies, sauces, pie fillings, and glazes. It can also be used to thicken custards, puddings, and other desserts! Corn starch has to be heated and cooked for a short period of time in order to lose its starchy taste. Heating it also brings out its thickening properties, making your dish just the right consistency.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Anti-Caking Agent</h3>
<p>Besides being used as a thickener, corn starch is also an anti-caking agent when mixed with powdered sugar. It is often added to batters for coating chicken and other foods to help them fry to crispy and flaky perfection!</p></td>

<h2 class="headline">Stock up on corn starch for your kitchen with this economical Packing!</h2>
<p><span>This must-have item is a staple in any restaurant's kitchen. Many people prefer to use corn starch as a thickening agent since it dissolves clearly, and doesn't alter the color or appearance of dishes. However, corn starch does clump when added to hot liquids or mixtures, and should therefore be added in small quantities.</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Flavorless Thickener</h3>
<p>A nearly flavorless thickener, it's great for thickening a variety of recipes, including gravies, sauces, pie fillings, and glazes. It can also be used to thicken custards, puddings, and other desserts! Corn starch has to be heated and cooked for a short period of time in order to lose its starchy taste. Heating it also brings out its thickening properties, making your dish just the right consistency.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Anti-Caking Agent</h3>
<p>Besides being used as a thickener, corn starch is also an anti-caking agent when mixed with powdered sugar. It is often added to batters for coating chicken and other foods to help them fry to crispy and flaky perfection!</p></td>
