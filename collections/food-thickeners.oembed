Made from the starch of fresh potatoes, this dense powdery product is widely used for a variety of culinary applications. Potato starch is similar to corn starch and can be used as a replacement for corn starch in many recipes. It also has a higher heat tolerance than corn starch, making it perfect for thickening sauces, soups, and stews, in addition to puddings, pie fillings, and gravies. Use 4 tsp. of potato starch to substitute for every 1 Tbsp. of corn starch; when using it to thicken a liquid, mix the potato starch with a small amount of water to make a slurry before stirring it in to your recipe to help prevent clumping. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond thickening, potato starch also has numerous uses in baking. It helps add moistness to cakes, cookies, and other baked goods. It's also a key ingredient in shortbread recipes, where its fine texture produces crumbly and tender breads! Potato starch is also great for helping to produce a crispy texture in your sauteed or stir-fried meats and vegetables; coat small pieces of your desired ingredient in potato starch to produce a crispy coating. It's also the secret ingredient in the batter of extra-crispy deep fried foods! Add potato starch to the batter of your fried fish, onion rings, or any other food you want to fry up with a crispy, golden-brown coating. It's especially popular as an ingredient in crispy-yet-moist Japanese Karaage chicken. No matter how you use it, this potato starch is sure to be a key ingredient in your busy kitchen; this bulk 10 Kg supply will keep you well-stocked for all of your culinary needs!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"MillBrook","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":39333248303178,"sku":"51106","price":34.99,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/5466\/0678\/products\/millbrook-potato-starch-10-kg-668873.jpg?v=1623735229"}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/5466\/0678\/collections\/food-thickeners-624496.jpg?v=1611508866","url":"https:\/\/bulkmart.ca\/collections\/food-thickeners.oembed","provider":"Bulk Mart","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
