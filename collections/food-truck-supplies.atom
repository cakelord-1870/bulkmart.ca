Perfect for both hot and cold foods, this plate is an ideal solution for quick-serve restaurants, caterers, and cafes.</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Eco-Friendly Construction</h3>
<p>Made from bagasse, a by-product of sugarcane processing, this product is compostable, which allows you to decrease your carbon footprint. While other disposable products are burned when thrown away causing air pollution, this can be renewed and recycled. In addition, this dinnerware is made with superior strength and won't break or crack under moderate pressure. It can even handle the messiest of menu items thanks to its oil proof design.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Wide Rim</h3>
<p>Thanks to a wide rim, you can serve saucy foods on this plate without worrying about spills and messes.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Bright White Appearance</h3>
<p>With a bright white color, this plate will fit almost any restaurant decor and theme while creating a clean and fresh canvas for any type of food.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Superior Alternative</h3>
<p>This sugarcane / bagasse item takes up less storage space than other disposable alternatives, and it can hold heavier foods than either paper or Styrofoam. Plus, since it requires much less energy to produce, it saves on both energy and resources.</p></td>
