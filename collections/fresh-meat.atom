<div class="cut-desc">Small, thin, lean, incredibly tender muscles located on either side of the backbone, tenderloins are the most prized cut on the entire animal. Their buttery tenderness is legendary and people are willing to pay very high prices for tenderloin roasts &amp; filet mignon steaks.<br><br>This cut has a relatively mild flavor (though grass-fed tenderloins are more flavorful than grain-fed ones), so tenderloin roasts &amp; steaks are frequently paired with sauces that add moisture &amp; additional flavor. One of the fancier classical roast recipes, Beef Wellington, is traditionally made with beef tenderloin. This is also an excellent cut for making steak tartare and carpaccio.<br><br>Tenderloins have a narrow end and a thick end. To ensure consistency, roasts &amp; steaks are typically cut from the thick end. Roasts can be made from the thin end by cutting the smallest portion off and trussing it to a thicker portion using butcher’s twine. The thin end can also be sliced for beef medallions.<br><br>Applications: Roast Whole or in Portions, or Slice into Chateaubriand or Filet Mignon Steaks.<br>

<div class="cut-desc">A long, narrow, and lean muscle located within the Loin, this is the most tender cut of beef available. The Tenderloin is the source of Tenderloin Steak or Filet Mignon, and is a component of T-Bone and Porterhouse Steaks.</div>

<div class="cut-desc">Small, thin, lean, incredibly tender muscles located on either side of the backbone, tenderloins are the most prized cut on the entire animal. Their buttery tenderness is legendary and people are willing to pay very high prices for tenderloin roasts &amp; filet mignon steaks.<br><br>This cut has a relatively mild flavor (though grass-fed tenderloins are more flavorful than grain-fed ones), so tenderloin roasts &amp; steaks are frequently paired with sauces that add moisture &amp; additional flavor. One of the fancier classical roast recipes, Beef Wellington, is traditionally made with beef tenderloin. This is also an excellent cut for making steak tartare and carpaccio.<br><br>Tenderloins have a narrow end and a thick end. To ensure consistency, roasts &amp; steaks are typically cut from the thick end. Roasts can be made from the thin end by cutting the smallest portion off and trussing it to a thicker portion using butcher’s twine. The thin end can also be sliced for beef medallions.<br><br>Applications: Roast Whole or in Portions, or Slice into Chateaubriand or Filet Mignon Steaks.</div>

It’s also very adaptable and can be used in formed applications like burgers, meatballs &amp; meatloaf, or can be broken up and browned for use in tacos &amp; sauces. It’s typically produced from tougher cuts that offer excellent flavor but need to be ground to be tender. This ground beef is only ground from whole muscles, never trim, which gives it superior texture.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">This beef has been ground with an 85%/15% lean/fat ratio. This fat ratio is perfect for burgers, meatballs, meatloaf, and other formed applications because the fat will help keep them moist.<br data-mce-fragment="1"><br data-mce-fragment="1">Applications: Burgers, Meatballs, Tacos, Sauces, Meatloaf, Etc.</p>
