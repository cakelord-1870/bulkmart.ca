<p>Battered to perfection. These portions are hand cut for a perfect Taco and work well for small fish &amp; chip meals. Being pre-battered brings easy preparation into the kitchen and convenient portion control to the plate for a reasonable price</p>
<p><span>This excellent item was created with a Mexican influence in mind! Cut to fit perfectly in a standard tortilla this product takes some of the work out of preparing this popular item. Fresh salsa, cabbage or lettuce with a tasty sauce and you will have your customer coming back for more. Although created with a taco concept in mind this product is also ideal for a smaller portion fish &amp; chip with senior or kids meals in mind.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Ready for the oven or Deep fryer.</li>
<li>One of the lightest batters in the industry “Less batter, more Fish.”</li>
<li>Tight sizing spec for more control on actual food cost.</li>
<li>Individually quick frozen.</li>
<li>Great for kids or seniors, Fish &amp; Chips sized.</li>
