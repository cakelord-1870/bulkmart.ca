<p itemprop="description">Add a versatile and healthy ancient grain to your pantry with this Millbrook spelt flour! Spelt is a primitive relative of modern wheat and is one of the oldest cultivated grains; some evidence suggests that humans have been growing and eating it for as long as 8000 years. Though modern wheat has been more widely cultivated than spelt for centuries, spelt is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative to traditional wheat flours! Because it is related to wheat, spelt flour contains gluten, but the gluten proteins in spelt are more water soluble than those in wheat, making it easier to digest. This means that spelt flour should not be eaten by people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, though some people with wheat allergies and mild gluten sensitivities report that spelt is more easy to digest than flour. Its unique genetic structure also makes spelt flour a great source of protein and essential minerals including manganese, zinc, and copper! <br>Because of its similarity to wheat, spelt flour can be used in practically any recipe that calls for all-purpose or wheat flour. Spelt adds a uniquely nutty flavor and a light texture to your baked goods! Spelt can generally be substituted for 50% of the wheat flour in a recipe, though if you have not used it before, you may want to start out by substituting 25% spelt flour and working your way up as you become more familiar with it. It's especially good for use in breads, pancakes, and cookies! No matter how you choose to use it, this ancient grain will add delicious flavor and wholesome nutrition to baked goods in your restaurant, bakery or cafe.

<p itemprop="description">Used for centuries in Middle Eastern and South East Asian cuisine, garbanzo bean flour is full of flavor and vital nutrients. Add this ancient ingredient to your pantry with Millbrook garbanzo bean flour! Also known as chickpea flour, gram flour, and besan, garbanzo bean flour is made by grinding garbanzo beans (also known as chickpeas) into a fine powder. Since they're not a grain, garbanzo beans are naturally gluten free; better yet, this flour is processed in Millbrook gluten-free facility, where their products undergo stringent testing to ensure that they don't contain any traces of gluten. That makes this flour perfect for your gluten-free customers, including those with celiac disease! In addition to being gluten free, garbanzo bean flour has a rich, slightly sweet flavor very similar to the taste of chickpeas. It's also loaded with essential nutrients like protein, dietary fiber, and iron, making it a more nutritious alternative to traditional wheat flours!<br><br>In India, France, and Italy, garbanzo bean flour is used to make a light, unleavened pancake that can be eaten alone or used to wrap the ingredients of your choice. For a simple version, try using garbanzo bean flour, water, and a pinch of salt to form a batter that can be perfectly pan-fried. These pancakes can be used to create gluten-free wraps and flatbreads, and because they're vegan, they're perfect for many of your customers with dietary restrictions! Garbanzo bean flour can also be used to make a vegan cheese substitute; when mixed with water and cooked over medium heat until it reaches a roux-like consistency, it forms a creamy, cheesy sauce that's great for vegan dips and spreads.<br><br>Though it's not a 1-to-1 substitute for all-purpose flour, garbanzo bean flour is a versatile addition to your flour arsenal, whether you use it alone or combined with other flours. Garbanzo bean flour is an excellent solution to the perennial issue of texture in gluten-free baking; it has natural binding properties that mimic the "stickiness" of gluten to help bind your baked goods together and give them a sturdy-yet-tender texture that your customers will love! Use it to make savory baked goods like artisan breads, pizza crusts, and crackers. It's also great for sweet treats made with strong flavors that will stand up to the garbanzo bean flour's distinctive taste; use it in a chocolate fudge cake or a warm pumpkin bread!<br><br></p></td>

<p><span>Enjoy the revitalizing effects of green tea with a fruity twist when you serve this Steep by Bigelow organic green tea with pomegranate! This flavorful green tea blend includes organic hibiscus, rose hips, pomegranate peel, and other natural flavors. When brewed, it has a light color and fruity, floral aroma. This green tea comes from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant and undergoes a special handling process, leaving the green tea blend more delicate and lower in caffeine than black tea. Additionally, green tea is full of antioxidants that are a great part of any healthy lifestyle. Steep by Bigelow organic teas, such as this green tea with pomegranate, are grown using only natural fertilizers that are free of synthetic pesticides and additives.</span><br><br><span>An organic alternative to standard tea bags, this tea is packed with naturally-delicious flavor in each cup that you steep. Plus, it is made with simple, quality ingredients that are gluten free and non-GMO. Committed to maintaining freshness and flavor, each tea bag is wrapped and sealed in a stay-fresh foil packet to protect the tea from air and moisture. Mix and match flavors and serve these convenient tea bags as-is at the table. This good-for-you, organic tea blend is perfect for your restaurant, coffee shop, office, or cafe!</span><br><br><b>Steeping Instructions:</b><br><span>Bring fresh cold water to a boil. Pour water over tea bag, and steep for about 4 minutes. Remove tea bag. For iced tea, steep a little longer and pour over ice.</span></p>
