<p><span>This chocolate Snaps is excellent in baking recipes, and for moulding and dipping, or eating on its own. These pure chocolate callets are easy to melt or temper, weigh, and store, and a divine taste in recipes calling for chunks of chocolate. Made using 100% pure cocoa butter and a dash of vanilla that rounds off the taste with a slight sweet hint. </span><br><span>Pure chocolate requires tempering to obtain a high gloss for chocolate making </span><br></p>

<p>Dark colored cocoa for a sweet and strong milk chocolate.</p>
<span id="product_description" itemprop="description">Cacao Barry Lactée Supérieure couverture combines successfully the advantages of both a sweet and strong milk chocolate. A dark-colored milk chocolate, Cacao Barry Lactée Supérieure finds itself at home most readily in confectionery, pastry and ice cream. That includes ganache praline centres, fine mouldings and coatings for sweets; such as pastry ganache, mousse or decorations in all manner of pastry; and providing exciting additional flavour to sorbets, ice cream and a wide variety of sauces.<br><br>Note: Due to high temperatures or high humidity, chocolate products may melt during shipment. We only ship chocolate during fall/winter/spring months when the temperature is cooler. However, we cannot guarantee that chocolate will not melt during the shipping process. Chocolate that has encountered melting will appear dull coloured or may have greyish/white streaks and dots. This is known as 'bloom' and indicates that the cocoa butter is separating from the chocolate and is rising to the surface. Although not the prettiest in appearance, chocolates with bloom are fine to eat with little inpact to the texture or taste of the chocolate.<br><br>- 38.2% min cacao / 38.1% fat / 22.9% milk<br>- Fluidity level: 4 out of 5<br>- Pistole format (ie. easy to use chocolate disc format)<br>- Cacao Barry "Origine" products all come in original Cacao Barry packaging</span>

<p><span>This chocolate Callets is excellent in baking recipes, and for moulding and dipping, or eating on its own. These pure chocolate callets are easy to melt or temper, weigh, and store, and a divine taste in recipes calling for chunks of chocolate. Made using 100% pure cocoa butter and a dash of vanilla that rounds off the taste with a slight sweet hint. </span><br><span>Pure chocolate requires tempering to obtain a high gloss for chocolate making </span><br></p>
