Hubberts Pure Beef Dripping is made this way by heating beef fat and recovering the rendered tallow. It cooks and improves the flavour of fish fillets, chicken fingers, pork cutlets, potatoes and vegetables. The dripping is lightly filtered so the fat is a pale, golden brown.

Olive pomace oil is a refined oil which is extracted from the olive pomace that is left behind after pressing, and combined with virgin olive oil for use. This pomace oil is great for achieving a silky smooth consistency, similar to that achieved by using first press olive oil, without the strong flavor intrusion of such oil. The lighter flavor and milder olive taste is versatile and won't clash with the other ingredients in your recipes.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis multi-purpose oil has many benefits for your commercial kitchen\u003c\/strong\u003e.
