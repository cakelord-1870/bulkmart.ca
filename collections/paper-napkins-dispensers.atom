<p><span>Perfect for serving along side messy finger foods like chicken wings, barbecue ribs, or crab legs, a moist towelette provides a method for quick and easy clean up that your guests will appreciate. Messy foods can leave guests' hands and faces covered in sticky sauces, but these towelettes enable them to immediately clean up without accidentally rubbing their dirty hands on your clean tables or bathroom doorknobs. Plus, they'll feel more comfortable and might decide to stay or order dessert!</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Individually Packaged</h3>
<p>Individually packaged in a special wrapper that keeps the wipes from drying out, these small wipes can be easily stored in wait staff's aprons and distributed to tables after delivering food, or placed in every carry-out bag as a courtesy for guests who are picking up orders.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Fresh Lemon Scent</h3>
<p>Featuring a fresh lemon scent, these wipes clean without customers having to go wash their hands, making them convenient for cleaning up on the go. After use, the cleaned surfaces self-dry in seconds, leaving the skin feeling soft and smooth.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Outdoor Dining and Messy Foods</h3>
<p>Especially useful for outdoor dining or food trucks when sinks aren't available, these thick, strong wipes get the job done and will leave your guests feeling clean and rejuvenated. If you are serving sauce-covered wings or seasoned hard-shell crabs at your establishment, your guests will be expecting moist towelettes to be provided.</p></td>
