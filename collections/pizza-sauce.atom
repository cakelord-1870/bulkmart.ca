<p><span>This sauce base provides the deep red color and a rich blend of tangy, sweet, and salty flavors your customers crave. Packed with high quality California vine-ripened tomatoes, extra-virgin olive oil, a blend of Italian seasonings, and fresh basil, this pizza sauce base has a smooth, velvety consistency that provides maximum spreadability. With the belief that quality products create quality customers, you can always rest assured you are serving the best.</span></p>

<p>It saves you most of the prep work in your high-volume kitchen while allowing you to add your own personal touch to your pizzas. Plus, its convenient bulk# 10 can size allows you to provide ample amounts of sauce at a time to your guest</p>
