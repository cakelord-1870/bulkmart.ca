All yeast, which acts as a leavening agent, converts sugars found in dough into carbon dioxide, causing the dough to expand. This process is what helps give bread the soft and airy texture we all know and love! <strong>This bag of instant dry yeast is perfect for making delicious bagels, croissants, donuts, and more.</strong></span></p></td>
