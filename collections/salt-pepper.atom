<p><span><strong>There is no ingredient more versatile and important in the kitchen than salt;</strong> ensure you are seasoning your foods with a high quality, all-purpose cooking salt, like this Diamond Crystal 3 lb. kosher salt! Certified kosher for Passover, these coarse salt crystals have a well-rounded flavor that, depending on the amount used, can be used in a variety of ways, from dampening bitterness and increasing a food's sweetness to reducing sweetness and increasing umami in your savory dishes. With its large plain salt crystals, this salt is easier to pinch and sprinkle atop your finished foods than table salt, making it a great way to assure your foods are not over salted. Use this versatile ingredient for seasoning meats prior to cooking, rimming margarita glasses, or making marinades. Whether it's blended into sauces, used for garnishing vegetables, or tossed with your popcorn, it will add an extra pinch of savory flavor to anything you make!<br><br><strong>This pure kosher salt contains no additives</strong> and contains 53% less sodium by volume in comparison to regular table salt. This salt is made using a proprietary evaporation process that creates unique hollow, multifaceted salt crystals that are perfect for controlled seasoning in your kitchen. Plus, its shape also influences its adherence to food surfaces, providing your meals with a fuller flavor. When your recipe calls for large quantities of salt, this box features an efficient side pour spout for quick and easy pouring. For a utility salt that dissolves and disperses quickly, stock your kitchen with this versatile salt for all your cooking needs.</span></p>

<h2 class="page-header-2">Bulk Whole Spices Add Flavor to Your Favorite Food and Drink Recipes</h2>
<p><span>Whole spices are loaded with flavor. They can be used whole for an aesthetically pleasing presentation or ground up just before use for added freshness.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Try adding this spice</strong> to salsa, guacamole, and taco or enchilada sauces for extra flavor, or allow guests to season their own meals via front-of-house condiment stations. Whether you run a Mexican or Indian restaurant, pizzeria, or upscale bistro, this spice is sure to take your food to the next level.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>Its a pantry staple</strong> that can be used in marinades, tomato-based sauces, and soups. Whether you own a pizzeria, Italian restaurant, or upscale bistro, this spice is the perfect addition to all of your favorite menu items.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The unique and delicious flavor and aroma</strong> is commonly used in Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and Italian cuisines. However, it also works well with traditional Canadian and American dishes.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-fragment="1"><strong>The bulk pack of spices</strong> is a cost-efficient option for high-volume kitchens and can easily be portioned into smaller quantities. Dehydrated spices also last longer than fresh ingredients and are easier to store, making them the perfect addition to any busy, high-output kitchen.</span></p>
