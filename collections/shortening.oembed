When a beef roast is cooked in the oven, beef fat is rendered from the meat. This fat collects in the bottom of the roasting pan and imparts a distinct flavour to the food. Hubberts Pure Beef Dripping is made this way by heating beef fat and recovering the rendered tallow. It cooks and improves the flavour of fish fillets, chicken fingers, pork cutlets, potatoes and vegetables. The dripping is lightly filtered so the fat is a pale, golden brown. It still carries a hint of beef flavour and aroma when heated and remains heat stable, therefore reducing the frequency of frying oil changes.
