Try adding a splash of mushroom flavored dark soy sauce to your next batch of fried rice or chow mein! It's also great for creating the thick sauce for takeout favorites like steak and broccoli. Be sure to add a small amount of dark soy sauce to start - it can easily overpower the other flavors in a dish, so it's best used sparingly!</span></p>
