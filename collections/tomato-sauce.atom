<p><span>Made with high-quality California vine-ripened tomatoes, this sauce is mildly seasoned and can be served straight from the can or used as a foundation for creating delicious homemade sauces. This sauce is perfect for restaurants and pizzerias who strive to achieve serving quality, Italian-style marinara sauce to their guests, but do not have the time or labor capacity to do so.</span></p>
<h3 class="item-header">Delicious Flavor</h3>
<p>With its smooth consistency and rich flavor, this marinara sauce is perfect for using in a variety of recipes, including traditional spaghetti dishes, stromboli, and even chicken and seafood dishes. It is also great for using as a dipping sauce for bread sticks and mozzarella sticks! The tomatoes experience minimal exposure to flavor-damaging heat to maximize the sauce's flavor profile. Plus, this sauce is packed from fresh tomatoes, and not from concentrate for maximum freshness.</p>
<h3 class="item-header">Real Italian Recipe</h3>
<p>With family roots in the small farms of Tuscany and Liguri in Italy, it is no surprise that Stanislaus is dedicated to the unwavering commitment to providing quality tomato products. Since 1942, Stanislaus's family-owned cannery has specialized in fresh-packing "Real Italian" tomato products to Italian restaurants and delivers homemade-quality products that are never from concentrate. With the belief that quality products create quality customers, you can always rest assured you are serving the best with Stanislaus.</p>
