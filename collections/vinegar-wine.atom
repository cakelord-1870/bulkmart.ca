<p><span>Red cooking wine is a full-bodied wine exclusively selected to enhance the flavour of your finest recipes. This wine keeps longer than table wine and does not require refrigeration. Ideal with meat, poultry and in sauces.</span></p>
<p><span>Wine is commonly used to add flavor to sauces and for deglazing and marinating. Be mindful of the fact that wine's flavors can concentrate when you reduce it. So if you want a sweeter sauce, pick a Port or other fortified wine, and if you'd like a sauce with a jammy taste, pick something with a full body. Wine needs to be cooked for 3 to 4 minutes after added to a recipe, so the flavors have a chance to meld.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Heinz malt vinegar makes the perfect complement</strong> to any serving of French fries or fish and chips! Manufactured from malt syrup that has been fermented to a malt "beer," this vinegar has a rich brown color and a pungent, full-bodied flavor. Serve malt vinegar at your concession stand counter or on any diner or restaurant tabletop so your guests can drizzle as much as they'd like atop their fresh-cut fries, meats, and fried fish.</span><br><br><span><strong>Compared to traditional oil and vinegar toppings,</strong> malt vinegar adds a nutty, toasted flavor to a variety of dishes, including salad dressings and coleslaws. A splash of malt vinegar kicks up the flavor of any traditional macaroni or bean salad. While it is widely-known to be a classic English condiment, this malt vinegar is a great asset for enhancing mainstream American foods with new flavors that will surely impress your guests!</span></p>

<p><span>This versatile vinegar is made from fermented rice and has a well-balanced acidity. With no fat and no calories per serving, rice vinegar is a healthy way to <strong>enhance your flavorful meals and sauces.</strong> It's made with no artificial ingredients, and it can be used in place of wine vinegar or lemon juice.</span><br><br><span>Though <strong>rice vinegar is popular in Japanese and Chinese cooking</strong>, it can be used in many cuisines. It is commonly found in dishes that are tangy or sweet, and it's also a popular <strong>salad dressing ingredient.</strong> Use it for <strong>pickling vegetables or add it to savory meat marinades.</strong> It also adds some zest to dipping sauces, soups, and stir-frys!</span></p>
<p><span>Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar by Yoshi has a milder flavour than other vinegars and it can be used in place of wine vinegar or lemon juice! <strong>The light and delicate balance provides the perfect flavour enhancement for vegetables, seafood, beef and poultry.</strong> Try it as a secret ingredient in sushi to elevate your favourite rolls</span></p>
