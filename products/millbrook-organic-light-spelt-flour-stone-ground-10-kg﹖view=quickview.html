Spelt is a primitive relative of modern wheat and is one of the oldest cultivated grains; some evidence suggests that humans have been growing and eating it for as long as 8000 years. Though modern wheat has been more widely cultivated than spelt for centuries, spelt is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative to traditional wheat flours! Because it is related to wheat, spelt flour contains gluten, but the gluten proteins in spelt are more water soluble than those in wheat, making it easier to digest. This means that spelt flour should not be eaten by people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, though some people with wheat allergies and mild gluten sensitivities report that spelt is more easy to digest than flour. Its unique genetic structure also makes spelt flour a great source of protein and essential minerals including manganese, zinc, and copper! \u003cbr\u003eBecause of its similarity to wheat, spelt flour can be used in practically any recipe that calls for all-purpose or wheat flour. Spelt adds a uniquely nutty flavor and a light texture to your baked goods! Spelt can generally be substituted for 50% of the wheat flour in a recipe, though if you have not used it before, you may want to start out by substituting 25% spelt flour and working your way up as you become more familiar with it. It's especially good for use in breads, pancakes, and cookies!

Spelt is a primitive relative of modern wheat and is one of the oldest cultivated grains; some evidence suggests that humans have been growing and eating it for as long as 8000 years. Though modern wheat has been more widely cultivated than spelt for centuries, spelt is gaining popularity as a healthy alternative to traditional wheat flours! Because it is related to wheat, spelt flour contains gluten, but the gluten proteins in spelt are more water soluble than those in wheat, making it easier to digest. This means that spelt flour should not be eaten by people with celiac disease or severe gluten sensitivities, though some people with wheat allergies and mild gluten sensitivities report that spelt is more easy to digest than flour. Its unique genetic structure also makes spelt flour a great source of protein and essential minerals including manganese, zinc, and copper! \u003cbr\u003eBecause of its similarity to wheat, spelt flour can be used in practically any recipe that calls for all-purpose or wheat flour. Spelt adds a uniquely nutty flavor and a light texture to your baked goods! Spelt can generally be substituted for 50% of the wheat flour in a recipe, though if you have not used it before, you may want to start out by substituting 25% spelt flour and working your way up as you become more familiar with it. It's especially good for use in breads, pancakes, and cookies! No matter how you choose to use it, this ancient grain will add delicious flavor and wholesome nutrition to baked goods in your restaurant, bakery or cafe. This 10 Kg bag will keep you well-stocked for all of your culinary needs!\u003c\/p\u003e"};
